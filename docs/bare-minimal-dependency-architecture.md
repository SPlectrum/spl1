# BARE Minimal Dependency Architecture for SPlectrum

## Overview

The BARE (Bare Architecture Runtime Environment) strategy creates a minimal dependency architecture optimized for peer-to-peer distribution via Holepunch Pear. This architecture ensures SPlectrum applications are self-contained, verifiable, and capable of operating in distributed environments without external infrastructure dependencies.

## Design Principles

### 1. Self-Contained Distribution
- All dependencies bundled within SPlectrum application
- No external package manager requirements during runtime or installation
- Complete functionality available offline and in isolated networks
- Perfect for Pear's peer-to-peer replication model

### 2. Dual Dependency Strategy

#### **External Tools → Container Strategy**
- Tools like `git`, `7zip`, `gh` containerized with multi-arch builds
- API wrappers in SPlectrum call container endpoints
- Clean separation of external executable dependencies
- Consistent behavior across different host environments

#### **JavaScript Modules → Vendored Strategy** 
- Essential JavaScript dependencies maintained as curated forks in `vendor/deps/`
- Complete control over updates and security patches
- No runtime dependency on npm or other package managers
- Deterministic builds for peer-to-peer verification

### 3. Pear Runtime Optimization
- Applications must bundle all dependencies for Pear distribution
- Deterministic dependency tree for peer verification
- Offline-first design principles
- No external network calls for dependency resolution

```

## Vendored Dependency Management

### 1. Curation Strategy
- **Fork upstream repositories** for all required JavaScript modules
- **Minimal functionality** - include only essential features needed by SPlectrum
- **Security-first** - regular security audits and prompt patch application
- **Version pinning** - explicit version control for all vendored dependencies

### 2. Maintenance Automation
```javascript
// automation/vendor-sync.js
const vendorSync = {
  // Monitor upstream repositories for security patches
  monitorUpstream: (dependency) => { /* track CVEs, security releases */ },
  
  // Automated testing of dependency updates
  testUpdate: (dependency, version) => { /* comprehensive test suite */ },
  
  // Automated merge of approved security patches
  applySecurityPatch: (dependency, patch) => { /* controlled patch application */ }
};
```

### 3. Dependency Categories

#### **Core Runtime Dependencies**
- Argument parsing (minimist fork)
- Path manipulation utilities
- Stream processing
- JSON/data manipulation

#### **Cryptographic Dependencies**
- Hash functions (for integrity verification)
- Signature verification
- Encryption utilities (for secure P2P communication)

#### **Development Dependencies**
- Testing framework (minimal test runner)
- Code formatting utilities
- Documentation generators

## Container Strategy for External Tools

### 1. Multi-Architecture Builds
```dockerfile
# vendor/containers/git/Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest as base
RUN apk add --no-cache git

# Multi-arch build targets
FROM base as amd64
FROM base as arm64
FROM base as armv7
```

### 2. API Wrapper Integration
```javascript
// modules/tools/git/index.js
const containerRuntime = require('../../spl/container');

const git = {
  add: (args) => containerRuntime.exec('git', ['add', ...args]),
  commit: (args) => containerRuntime.exec('git', ['commit', ...args]),
  // ... other git operations
};
```

### 3. Container Distribution
- Pre-built images for common architectures
- On-demand building for specific platforms
- Container image verification and signing

## Pear Application Integration

### 1. Pear Manifest Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "splectrum",
  "main": "modules/spl/app.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "vendor": "./vendor"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "containers": "./vendor/containers",
    "offline": true
  }
}
```

### 2. Peer-to-Peer Considerations
- **Deterministic builds** ensure identical applications across peers
- **Complete dependency bundling** eliminates network dependencies
- **Verification pipeline** allows peers to validate dependency integrity
- **Offline operation** maintains functionality without internet access

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Dependency Audit and Curation
1. **Audit current Node.js dependencies** across all SPlectrum modules
2. **Identify essential vs. removable** dependencies
3. **Create vendor forks** of essential dependencies
4. **Implement minimal versions** removing unused functionality

### Phase 2: Container Integration
1. **Containerize external tools** (git, 7zip, gh, podman)
2. **Build multi-arch images** for common platforms
3. **Implement container API wrappers** in SPlectrum modules
4. **Create container build automation**

### Phase 3: Automation Implementation
1. **Develop vendor maintenance automation** (monitoring, testing, patching)
2. **Implement security scanning pipeline** for vendored dependencies
3. **Create container build/distribution automation**
4. **Establish update and release processes**

### Phase 4: Pear Integration
1. **Configure Pear application manifest** for self-contained distribution
2. **Implement peer verification mechanisms** for dependency integrity
3. **Test offline operation** in isolated network environments
4. **Optimize for peer-to-peer replication performance**

## Benefits for Peer-to-Peer Environment

### 1. Infrastructure Independence
- No reliance on npm, package registries, or external repositories
- Complete functionality in air-gapped or restricted networks
- Resilient operation in unstable internet conditions

### 2. Security and Trust
- **Controlled update pipeline** - all updates go through SPlectrum review process
- **Auditable dependency tree** - peers can verify complete application integrity
- **No surprise updates** - dependency changes are explicit and controlled
- **Supply chain security** - reduced attack surface through dependency minimization

### 3. Distributed Application Benefits
- **Deterministic replication** - identical applications across all peers
- **Offline-first design** - full functionality without network connectivity
- **Peer verification** - cryptographic verification of complete application state
- **Predictable behavior** - consistent operation across diverse peer environments

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Automation Infrastructure
- **Continuous monitoring** of upstream dependencies for security updates
- **Automated testing pipeline** for dependency updates before integration
- **Multi-architecture container building** for broad platform support
- **Security scanning integration** for proactive vulnerability detection

### 2. Development Workflow Integration
- **Local development** with vendored dependencies for consistency
- **Testing isolation** ensuring tests run with exact production dependencies
- **Build reproducibility** for verifiable application distribution
- **Documentation generation** from minimal dependency specifications

### 3. Maintenance Processes
- **Regular security audits** of all vendored dependencies
- **Upstream monitoring** for important updates and security patches
- **Version management** strategy for dependency updates
- **Release coordination** between dependency updates and SPlectrum releases

This architecture creates a **truly self-sufficient SPlectrum** optimized for peer-to-peer distribution via Holepunch Pear, while maintaining the flexibility and functionality needed for comprehensive data processing and workflow automation.
