# SPL1 Versioning Strategy

## Overview

SPL1 continues the SPlectrum version lineage from spl0, starting at 0.6.1 and targeting 1.0 as the major milestone when Repository Restructure reaches its end goal state.

## Version Progression

### Starting Point: 0.6.1
- **Continuation**: spl0 ended at 0.5.x series
- **Fresh start**: spl1 begins development at 0.6.1
- **Clean slate**: New epic-based development approach

### Target Milestone: 1.0.0
- **Achievement**: Repository Restructure (RR) end goal completion
- **Significance**: Federated monorepo architecture fully implemented
- **Foundation**: Platform ready for mature post-1.0 development

## Version Composition Strategy

### 0.6.x Development Series
Versions follow PRINCE2 "just enough planning" progression:

#### Initial Versions
- **0.6.1 "Baseline"**: Seven-epic structure + initial analysis/planning issues
- **0.6.1 "Sufficient Analysis & Planning"**: First pass analysis enabling implementation
- **0.6.1+ "Implementation Phases"**: Based on sufficient understanding from 0.6.1

#### Thematic Grouping (Future Versions)
- **Foundation versions**: RR + TDD phases establishing platform
- **Enhancement versions**: CAE + SE phases improving functionality  
- **Integration versions**: AVRO + BARE phases modernizing architecture
- **Supporting versions**: NFD phases delivering cross-epic tools

#### Release Criteria
Each version must deliver:
- **Sufficient progress** - Enough advancement to enable next steps
- **Manageable scope** - Realistic completion within available resources
- **Clear value** - Meaningful improvement for development workflow
- **Progress toward 1.0** - Advancing Repository Restructure goals

#### Version Types
- **Minor versions** (0.6.1 → 0.7.0): Significant capability additions
- **Patch versions** (0.6.1 → 0.6.1): Analysis, planning, and incremental progress
- **Pre-release** (0.6.1-alpha.1): Testing builds for phase integration

## Epic Phase Integration

### Cross-Epic Dependencies
Versions coordinate phases that work together:
- **RR-1 + TDD-1**: Foundation + quality framework
- **CAE-1 + SE-1**: Enhanced APIs + deployment engines
- **BARE-1 + AVRO-1**: Modern architecture + data schema

### Independent Delivery
Some phases can ship independently:
- **NFD phases**: Supporting tools and frameworks
- **Bug fix phases**: Addressing issues in completed work
- **Documentation phases**: Improving platform understanding

## Release Management

### Version Planning
1. **Phase completion assessment** - Which epic phases are ready?
2. **Thematic coherence evaluation** - Do completed phases work together?
3. **Value delivery confirmation** - Does combination provide clear benefits?
4. **1.0 progress review** - How does this advance Repository Restructure goals?

### Release Process
1. **Phase integration testing** - Ensure phases work together correctly
2. **Documentation updates** - Reflect new capabilities and changes
3. **GitHub release creation** - Tag version with release notes
4. **Archive generation** - Create SPlectrum.7z distribution package

### Version 1.0 Criteria
Repository Restructure end goal achievement:
- **Federated architecture** fully implemented
- **Single-concern separation** complete across all components
- **Clean interfaces** between core/, apps/, tools/, docs/
- **Migration path** established for future repository evolution

## Learning and Adaptation

### Version Retrospectives
After each release:
- **Development efficiency** assessment
- **Version composition** effectiveness review  
- **User feedback** integration into future planning
- **1.0 timeline** adjustment based on progress

### Strategy Evolution
The versioning strategy adapts based on:
- **Epic completion patterns** - Which phases naturally group together
- **Development velocity** - Realistic timeframes for version composition
- **Platform needs** - User requirements driving version priorities
- **Technical dependencies** - Implementation constraints affecting phase sequencing
