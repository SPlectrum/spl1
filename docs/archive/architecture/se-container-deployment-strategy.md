# SE Container Deployment Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the deployment strategy for SPlectrum Engine (SE) containers, covering container runtime selection, orchestration approaches, peer-to-peer networking, and distributed execution patterns using AVRO RPC services.

## Container Runtime Strategy

### Podman as Primary Runtime

**Selected Runtime**: Podman (over Docker/k8s)

**Rationale**:
- **Rootless execution**: Better security for development workflows
- **Daemonless architecture**: No background service management complexity
- **Docker compatibility**: Can use existing container patterns and images
- **Pod management**: Natural fit for orchestrating multiple SE containers
- **Development friendly**: Immediate start/stop, easy debugging
- **Resource efficiency**: Lower overhead than cluster solutions

**Container Lifecycle Management**:

**Interactive Terminal Mode**:
```bash
# Claude spawns long-running container
podman run -it --rm \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/workspace \
  --env GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
  se-container:latest shell

# Inside container
se> execute VERSION_TRANSITION
se> status
se> exit  # Claude exits when done
```

**Fire-and-Forget Mode**:
```bash
# Claude spawns ephemeral containers
podman run --rm -d \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd),target=/workspace \
  --env GITHUB_TOKEN=$GITHUB_TOKEN \
  se-container:latest execute VERSION_TRANSITION

# Multiple parallel workflows
podman run --rm -d --name audit-analysis se-container:latest execute AUDIT_ANALYSIS
podman run --rm -d --name repo-maintenance se-container:latest execute REPOSITORY_MAINTENANCE
```

### Container Installation Strategy

**Requirements**: Podman must be installed (not a standalone executable)

**Installation Options**:
- **Native Installation**: Platform-specific package managers
- **Podman Desktop**: GUI + CLI for user-friendly management
- **Development Environment**: Standard part of SE development setup

**Fallback Strategy**: Design SE container logic to also work as standalone scripts for environments where container runtime isn't available

## Orchestration Strategy Evaluation

### k0s/Kubernetes Assessment

**Decision**: Avoid k0s/Kubernetes for current SE container use cases

**Analysis**:

**Podman Advantages for SE Containers**:
- **Single-node execution**: SE containers run on developer machines/single hosts
- **Simple lifecycle**: Spawn container → execute workflow → exit
- **Direct repository access**: Native filesystem mounting
- **Development friendly**: No cluster management overhead

**k0s/k8s Scenarios (Future Potential)**:
- **Multi-repository workflows**: Orchestrating across multiple SPlectrum repositories
- **Federated development**: Coordinating SE containers across distributed teams
- **Resource management**: Sophisticated scheduling/scaling requirements
- **High-performance computing**: Hundreds of SE nodes on complex analysis

**Architecture Mismatch Analysis**:
- SE containers are **stateless** → No need for k8s state management
- **Repository-based persistence** → No need for k8s volumes/storage
- **Single workflow execution** → No need for k8s service discovery
- **Development workflows** → k8s complexity adds friction without value

**Design Principle**: Start simple (Podman), evolve to P2P, reserve orchestration for proven high-value scenarios

## Peer-to-Peer Architecture Strategy

### P2P as Alternative to Orchestration

**Core Insight**: P2P done right often eliminates the need for orchestration complexity

**P2P Advantages Over k8s/k0s**:

**Simplicity**:
- No cluster management overhead
- No central coordination points of failure  
- Self-organizing SE networks
- Natural development workflow fit

**Scaling**:
- SE nodes join/leave network dynamically
- Load distributes organically across available nodes
- No resource scheduling complexity
- Handles both single-developer and team scenarios

**Resilience**:
- Fault tolerance through redundancy, not infrastructure
- SE nodes work independently when network partitioned
- Gradual degradation instead of cluster failures

### P2P Evolution Path

**Architecture Evolution**:
```
Current: Single SE container per workflow (Podman)
    ↓
P2P: SE nodes discover and coordinate directly
    ↓  
High-performance: Specialized cluster only when needed (rare)
```

**P2P Sweet Spots**:
- **Cross-repository workflows**: SE nodes coordinate directly
- **Distributed builds**: Repository-specific SE nodes collaborate  
- **Version transitions**: SE nodes share state and coordinate handoffs
- **Knowledge sharing**: SE nodes exchange insights and patterns

**P2P Integration with Bare Runtime**:
- Aligns perfectly with future Bare runtime strategy
- Elegant distributed coordination without infrastructure complexity
- Native performance for peer-to-peer scenarios

## AVRO RPC Service Architecture

### Service-Oriented SE Node Communication

**AVRO RPC Selection**: Leverages AVRO's client-server service capabilities with transport protocol agnostic design

**Service Definition Approach**:
```avro
protocol SENodeCoordination {
  // Workflow execution services
  WorkflowResult executeWorkflow(WorkflowRequest request);
  WorkflowStatus getWorkflowStatus(string workflowId);
  boolean resumeWorkflow(string workflowId, InterventionResult intervention);
  
  // Node discovery and capability services  
  NodeCapabilities getCapabilities();
  boolean requestWorkflowHandoff(WorkflowHandoffRequest request);
  void notifyWorkflowComplete(WorkflowCompletionNotice notice);
}
```

### Transport Protocol Flexibility

**Multi-Protocol Support**:
- **HTTP**: Web-friendly SE node communication
- **TCP**: High-performance direct node-to-node
- **WebSockets**: Real-time workflow coordination  
- **Unix sockets**: Local inter-process SE communication
- **Custom protocols**: Optimized for P2P mesh networks

**Transport Selection Strategy**:
- **Local development**: Unix sockets for speed
- **LAN deployment**: TCP for efficiency
- **Internet P2P**: HTTP/WebSockets for firewall traversal  
- **Edge cases**: Custom protocols optimized for specific networks

### Transparent Distributed Execution

**User Experience Design**: User always interacts with local SE node, distribution is completely abstracted

**Example User Flow**:
```bash
# User always interacts with local SE node
claude: se execute VERSION_TRANSITION
# Behind scenes: Local SE discovers that remote SE-Node-B has GitHub access
# Transparently routes execution to SE-Node-B via AVRO RPC
# User sees normal progress output, unaware of distribution
```

**SE Node Mesh Architecture**:

**Local SE Node (User Interface)**:
- **API Gateway**: Exposes familiar `se execute` interface
- **Capability Discovery**: Knows which remote nodes have what capabilities
- **Request Routing**: Transparently forwards to appropriate remote nodes
- **Response Aggregation**: Streams back results as if local execution

**Remote SE Nodes (Specialized Services)**:
- **GitHub-enabled nodes**: Have network access and credentials
- **Repository-specific nodes**: Have access to specific repositories  
- **High-performance nodes**: Handle compute-intensive workflows
- **Tool-specific nodes**: Have specialized tools or dependencies

### Service Discovery Protocol

**AVRO RPC Capability Discovery**:
```avro
protocol SENodeCapabilities {
  // Node announces its capabilities
  NodeCapabilities registerCapabilities(NodeMetadata metadata);
  
  // Local node queries for workflow execution
  array<NodeEndpoint> findNodesForWorkflow(WorkflowRequirements requirements);
  
  // Execution coordination
  WorkflowExecutionStream executeRemoteWorkflow(WorkflowRequest request);
  
  // Audit and logging coordination
  boolean submitAuditEntry(AuditLogEntry entry);
  AuditLogSummary getDistributedAuditSummary(string workflowId);
}
```

**Transparent Routing Examples**:
- **GitHub operations**: Route to nodes with GitHub API access
- **Heavy analysis**: Route to high-memory nodes
- **Cross-repo workflows**: Route to nodes with multi-repo access
- **Specialized tools**: Route to nodes with specific tool installations

**Benefits**:
- **User simplicity**: Same interface regardless of execution location
- **Resource optimization**: Work runs where resources are available
- **Access abstraction**: Local nodes don't need all credentials/access
- **Fault tolerance**: Fallback between capable nodes
- **Complete audit trail**: Distributed execution fully logged and traceable

This creates **true distributed SE execution** while maintaining the simple user experience!

## Distributed Audit Logging Strategy

### SE Node Audit Coordination

**Audit Requirements for Distributed Execution**:
- **Complete traceability**: Every workflow step logged regardless of execution node
- **Unified audit trail**: Distributed execution appears as single workflow in audit logs
- **Node accountability**: Track which nodes executed which workflow steps
- **Performance metrics**: Measure distributed execution overhead and efficiency

### Audit Architecture for SE Mesh

**Local Audit Aggregation**:
```bash
# Local SE node maintains unified audit log
claude/audit/current/current.log
##→2025-06-23T10:30:00Z | SE_DISTRIBUTED | workflow_start: VERSION_TRANSITION routed to se-node-github-01
##→2025-06-23T10:30:15Z | SE_DISTRIBUTED | step_1_complete: audit analysis on se-node-compute-01 
##→2025-06-23T10:32:30Z | SE_DISTRIBUTED | intervention_request: merge conflict resolution needed
##→2025-06-23T10:35:00Z | SE_DISTRIBUTED | intervention_resolved: conflicts resolved locally
##→2025-06-23T10:35:15Z | SE_DISTRIBUTED | workflow_resume: execution continues on se-node-github-01
##→2025-06-23T10:40:00Z | SE_DISTRIBUTED | workflow_complete: VERSION_TRANSITION completed successfully
```

**Distributed Audit Collection**:
- **Remote nodes**: Send audit entries back to local SE node via AVRO RPC
- **Local node**: Aggregates all distributed audit entries into unified log
- **Repository**: Final audit state reflects complete distributed execution history
- **Intervention tracking**: Claude interventions logged with node coordination context

### Audit Schema for Distributed Execution

**AVRO Audit Messages**:
```avro
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "DistributedAuditEntry",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "timestamp", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "sourceNodeId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "workflowId", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "workflowStep", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "executionContext", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "domains", "type": {"type": "array", "items": "string"}},
    {"name": "files", "type": {"type": "array", "items": "string"}},
    {"name": "interventionRequired", "type": "boolean"},
    {"name": "performanceMetrics", "type": ["null", "ExecutionMetrics"]}
  ]
}
```

**Performance and Coordination Metrics**:
- **Node routing overhead**: Time spent discovering and routing to appropriate nodes
- **Network latency**: Communication delays in distributed execution
- **Intervention coordination**: Time for dialogue pattern completion across nodes
- **Resource utilization**: Distributed vs local execution efficiency comparisons

### Audit Integration Benefits

**Complete Accountability**:
- **Workflow transparency**: Users see complete execution history regardless of distribution
- **Node performance tracking**: Identify optimal nodes for specific workflow types  
- **Intervention analysis**: Understand when and why distributed execution requires local intervention
- **Resource optimization**: Data-driven decisions about node specialization and routing

**Debugging and Analysis**:
- **Distributed debugging**: Trace workflow execution across multiple SE nodes
- **Performance analysis**: Identify bottlenecks in distributed vs local execution
- **Coordination effectiveness**: Measure dialogue pattern success in distributed scenarios
- **Node reliability**: Track which nodes provide most reliable execution

## Runtime Evolution Strategy

### Current to Future Runtime Migration

**Evolution Path**:
```
Current: SE Logic in Node.js → Container (Podman)
Future: SE Logic in Bare → Native execution (P2P/edge)
```

**Design Implications**:

**Current Container-First Phase**:
- SE containers with Node.js runtime for immediate implementation
- Leverage existing tools (all Node.js based)
- Rapid prototype development and testing

**Future Bare Runtime Phase**:
- SE logic rewritten in Bare for native execution
- Direct system integration without runtime overhead
- Optimal for P2P and resource-constrained environments

**Architecture Strategy**:
- **Interface Abstraction**: Design SE APIs to be runtime-agnostic
- **Logic Separation**: Keep workflow orchestration logic separate from runtime specifics
- **Tool Integration**: Plan for Bare-compatible tool rewrites
- **State Format**: Use runtime-neutral persistence (JSON files)

### Container-Optional Approach

**Current Mode (Container-First)**:
- **Podman default**: Leverages total packaging strategy
- **Development workflow**: Consistent execution environment
- **Distribution**: SE containers through container registry
- **Integration**: Fits naturally with container unified entity approach

**Future Evolution (Container-Optional)**:
- **P2P scenarios**: SE logic runs as standalone Bare where containers aren't viable
- **Edge cases**: Environments without container runtime support
- **Flexibility**: Same SE logic, different execution contexts

## Integration with SPlectrum Ecosystem

### AVRO Service Consistency

**Unified Service Communication**:
- **Consistent patterns**: Same AVRO approach across all SPlectrum services
- **Tooling reuse**: Leverage existing AVRO infrastructure
- **Schema registry**: Centralized SE communication protocol management
- **Version management**: Coordinated evolution with other SPlectrum components

**Benefits**:
- SE nodes become first-class participants in broader SPlectrum ecosystem
- Consistent service patterns across all SPlectrum components
- Reuse of AVRO tooling and infrastructure investments

### Total Packaging Strategy Alignment

**Container Unified Entity Integration**:
- SE containers fit naturally with broader containerization strategy
