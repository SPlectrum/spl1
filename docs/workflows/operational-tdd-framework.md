# Operational TDD Framework

## Overview

**Operational Test-Driven Development (Operational TDD)** extends SPlectrum's TDD practices to validate development workflows, process integrity, and operational compliance. While traditional TDD focuses on application code quality, Operational TDD ensures **process quality** and **development environment reliability**.

## Core Principle

**Process Quality = Code Quality**: SPlectrum platform reliability depends equally on robust application code and reliable development processes. Both require systematic testing and validation.

## SPlectrum TDD Strategy Enhancement

### **Expanded Testing Framework:**
```
SPlectrum Testing Framework:
├── Application Tests (existing)
│   ├── Unit Tests - Component behavior validation
│   ├── Integration Tests - Component interaction validation  
│   ├── E2E Tests - Complete user workflow validation
│   └── Performance Tests - Scalability and performance validation
└── Operational Tests (new)
    ├── Workflow Validation - Development process execution
    ├── Compliance Checking - MANDATORY rule adherence
    ├── Process Integrity - Workflow completeness and sequencing
    ├── Environment Health - Development environment state validation
    └── Recovery Testing - Operational failure detection and recovery
```

## Operational TDD Categories

### **1. Workflow Validation Testing**
**Purpose**: Validate that development workflows execute completely and correctly

**Test Areas:**
- **Workflow Completeness**: All mandatory steps execute
- **Step Sequencing**: Workflows follow defined patterns
- **State Transitions**: Repository state changes as expected
- **Integration Points**: Workflows chain together properly

**Example Validation:**
```javascript
// Validate SESSION_START workflow execution
async function validateSessionStartWorkflow() {
  const auditEntries = await readCurrentAuditLog();
  return {
    hasWorkflowStart: checkForEntry(auditEntries, 'SESSION_START', 'workflow_start'),
    hasRepositoryCheck: checkForEntry(auditEntries, 'SESSION_START', 'step'),
    hasCompletion: checkForEntry(auditEntries, 'SESSION_START', 'workflow_complete'),
    followsPattern: validateAuditPattern(auditEntries, 'SESSION_START')
  };
}
```

### **2. Compliance Testing**
**Purpose**: Validate adherence to MANDATORY operational rules

**Test Areas:**
- **Branch Policy Compliance**: Repository on correct branch, clean state
- **File Path Specification**: All references use exact file paths
- **Workflow Logging**: Proper audit log format and completeness
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Single-step completion with choice points

**Example Validation:**
```javascript
// Validate MANDATORY rule compliance
async function validateMandatoryRules() {
  return {
    branchPolicy: await checkBranchCompliance(),
    filePathReferences: await validateAllFileReferences(),
    workflowLogging: await validateAuditLogIntegrity(),
    stepByStepPattern: await checkChoicePointExecution()
  };
}
```

### **3. Process Integrity Testing**
**Purpose**: Validate development process reliability and consistency

**Test Areas:**
- **Audit Log Integrity**: Complete workflow accountability
- **Session Continuity**: Incomplete workflow detection and recovery
- **File Organization**: Claude directory structure compliance
- **Documentation Consistency**: Workflow docs synchronized with CLAUDE.md

**Example Validation:**
```javascript
// Validate process integrity
async function validateProcessIntegrity() {
  return {
    auditIntegrity: await validateAuditLogFormat(),
    sessionContinuity: await detectIncompleteWorkflows(),
    fileOrganization: await validateClaudeDirectoryStructure(),
    documentationSync: await checkWorkflowDocumentationConsistency()
  };
}
```

### **4. Environment Health Testing**
**Purpose**: Validate development environment operational state

**Test Areas:**
- **Repository State**: Clean working directory, correct branch
- **Tool Availability**: Required tools accessible and functional
- **Configuration Validity**: Settings and configuration files correct
- **Dependency Integrity**: All operational dependencies available

**Example Validation:**
```javascript
// Validate environment health
async function validateEnvironmentHealth() {
  return {
    repositoryState: await checkRepositoryCleanState(),
    toolAvailability: await validateRequiredTools(),
    configurationValidity: await validateOperationalConfiguration(),
    dependencyIntegrity: await checkOperationalDependencies()
  };
}
```

### **5. Recovery Testing**
**Purpose**: Validate operational failure detection and recovery capabilities

**Test Areas:**
- **Incomplete Workflow Detection**: Identify workflows that didn't complete
- **Session Recovery**: Restore operational state after interruption
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of operational errors
- **State Restoration**: Return to known good operational state

**Example Validation:**
```javascript
// Validate recovery capabilities
async function validateRecoveryCapabilities() {
  return {
    incompleteWorkflowDetection: await detectIncompleteWorkflows(),
    sessionRecovery: await testSessionRecoveryMechanisms(),
    errorHandling: await validateOperationalErrorHandling(),
    stateRestoration: await testStateRestorationCapabilities()
  };
}
```
