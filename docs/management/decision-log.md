# Decision Log (spl1 v0.6.1)

## Purpose

This log tracks strategic and architectural decisions that impact SPlectrum development. Entries capture context, rationale, and impact for future reference and learning.

**Version Archiving**: This log must be archived when creating new versions/releases following the same pattern as timelog archiving - archive to `/logs/archive/decision-log_v<version>.md` before git tagging new versions.

## Decision Criteria

Decisions should be logged when they meet any of these criteria:
1. **Strategic Direction Changes** - Alters epic goals or overall architecture
2. **Technical Architecture** - Affects core platform design or API structures  
3. **Workflow/Process Changes** - Modifies development or operational procedures
4. **Technology Adoption/Rejection** - Choosing or abandoning tools/frameworks
5. **Epic Scope Modifications** - Changes to epic definitions or priorities

## Format

```
## YYYY-MM-DD: Decision Title
**Context**: Brief situation description
**Decision**: What was decided
**Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
**Impact**: Which epics/areas affected
```

## Decisions

## 2025-06-17: Repository Todo List for Session Continuity

**Context**: Need to maintain discussion topics and todos across Claude Code sessions to ensure continuity and prevent forgotten items.

**Decision**: Created persistent repository todo list at `todo-list.md` and integrated into SESSION_START workflow.

**Rationale**: 
- Claude Code sessions are stateless - todos don't persist between sessions
- Important discussion topics were getting lost between sessions
- Manual todo tracking in session memory insufficient for project continuity
- Repository-based persistence ensures all team members can see pending items

**Impact**: 
- Enhanced session continuity through automated todo list checking
- SESSION_START workflow modified to include todo list review
- CLAUDE.md updated with persistent todo management documentation
- Development workflow efficiency improvement

## 2025-06-16: Container-Wrapped Git Repositories for RR Epic

**Context**: RR epic originally targeted transition from monorepo to multiple separate repositories for federated architecture.

**Decision**: Changed RR epic end goal to container-wrapped git repositories distributed through container registry.

**Rationale**: 
- Better alignment with container unified entity strategy
- Eliminates intermediate "multiple repos" migration step
- Creates self-contained development environments with zero external dependencies
- Enables registry-based dependency management instead of git submodules
- Provides cleaner path to container-native federated architecture

**Impact**: 
- RR epic scope and timeline
- Federated monorepo design strategy
- Container unified entity strategy integration
- Future distribution and deployment workflows
