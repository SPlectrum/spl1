# Future Development Priorities

This document tracks important development initiatives that should be addressed in future sessions. These are strategic improvements that will significantly enhance development efficiency and system reliability.

## High Priority: Environment Validation Framework

**Problem Statement**: Currently, development sessions involve significant time spent manually checking configurations, paths, module resolution, and context setup. This creates cognitive overhead and slows development velocity.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement a comprehensive test-driven environment validation framework that replaces manual checking with automated verification.

### Core Concept
Instead of manually verifying:
- Path resolution correctness
- Module loading functionality  
- Context configuration
- API availability
- Tool integration

Run a suite of essential tests that provide binary pass/fail validation of the entire environment.

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Essential Test Suite**
Create automated tests covering:
- Basic app execution: `./spl_execute spl boot --help`
- Module resolution: `./spl_execute spl boot spl/console/log "test"`
- Core API functionality: `./spl_execute spl boot spl/package/create --help`
- Tools integration: `./spl_execute spl boot tools/7zip/add --help`
- Path resolution: Archive creation and extraction tests
- Context setup: Debug output validation

**Phase 2: Integration**
- Add environment validation as first step in development workflows
- Create quick validation commands for common scenarios
- Integrate with existing test apps (test-boot, test-tools-*, etc.)
- Build into session startup procedures

**Phase 3: Expansion**
- Comprehensive test coverage for all SPL APIs
- Performance benchmarking tests
- Cross-platform validation
- Regression test automation

### Expected Benefits

**Development Efficiency**:
- Eliminate 5-10 minutes of manual checking per session
- Immediate feedback on environment state
- Faster identification of configuration issues
- Reduced cognitive overhead for Claude Code

**System Reliability**:
- Objective validation of system state
- Early detection of environment problems
- Consistent development experience
- Reduced debugging time

**Maintenance**:
- Automated verification of changes
- Regression detection
- Documentation through executable tests
- Onboarding simplification

### Success Metrics
- Time from session start to productive development < 2 minutes
- Environment configuration issues caught within first 30 seconds
- Zero manual path/context verification needed for routine development
- 90%+ pass rate on essential test suite in stable environments

### Implementation Notes
- Should be implemented before major spl/app API extensions
- Can be built incrementally alongside existing development
- Test framework should be self-validating
- Integration with existing test apps recommended

## Medium Priority: Development Management App

**Problem Statement**: Common development workflows (git operations, release cycles, testing patterns) require multiple manual commands and are prone to inconsistency across sessions.

**Proposed Solution**: Create a dedicated management app that provides standardized command routines for common development workflows.

### Target Functionality
**Git Workflow Commands**:
- `mgmt/git/stage-and-commit` - Automated staging and conventional commit creation
- `mgmt/git/release-cycle` - Complete release packaging, commit, and push workflow
- `mgmt/git/feature-branch` - Create feature branch with standard naming

**Development Workflow Commands**:
- `mgmt/dev/test-and-release` - Run tests, package apps, create release archive
- `mgmt/dev/new-app` - Scaffold new application with standard structure
- `mgmt/dev/deploy-changes` - Deploy changes through install → release → git cycle

**Quality Assurance Commands**:
- `mgmt/qa/validate-environment` - Run essential test suite for environment validation
- `mgmt/qa/pre-commit-checks` - Automated pre-commit validation and testing
- `mgmt/qa/integration-tests` - Cross-app integration testing

### Implementation Benefits
- **Consistency**: Standardized workflows across all development sessions
- **Efficiency**: Single commands replace multi-step manual processes
- **Quality**: Built-in validation and error checking
- **Documentation**: Workflows become self-documenting through code
- **Onboarding**: New developers can use standard commands immediately

### Implementation Notes
- Should use existing tools/git API for git operations
- Can leverage batch files for complex multi-step workflows
- Should include argument validation and helpful error messages
- Could include interactive prompts for common options

## Reminder Schedule
**Claude Code**: Please remind the user about this environment validation framework:
- At the start of sessions where manual checking is observed
- When configuration issues cause development delays
- During planning phases for new test applications
- Every 3-4 development sessions as a general reminder

This framework will significantly improve development velocity and should be prioritized when planning future work.
