- **Detailed docs** archived for reference when deep knowledge needed
- **Focus on actionable knowledge** rather than comprehensive coverage

**For Claude Development**:
- Start with essential guides in `guides/` 
- Reference archived material only when specific questions arise
- Prioritize practical patterns over theoretical understanding
