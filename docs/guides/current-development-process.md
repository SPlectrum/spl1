# Current Development Process

## Overview

**All future development is now managed through GitHub Issues and Projects.**

## Active Planning

**Current Version**: 0.6.1 (Planning baseline)
- **Status**: Available work items in [GitHub Project: SPL1 Development Workflow](https://github.com/orgs/SPlectrum/projects/1)
- **Recommendation Engine**: `node status/project-automation.js recommend`
- **Next Issue Selection**: Use **NEXT_ISSUE** workflow from CLAUDE.md

## Epic Organization

Development is organized into 7 epics with GitHub milestones:

1. **RR**: Repository Restructure ([RR-1 Milestone](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1/milestone/2))
2. **SE**: SPlectrum Engines ([SE-1 Milestone](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1/milestone/3)) 
3. **CAE**: Core API Enhancement ([CAE-1 Milestone](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1/milestone/4))
4. **TDD**: TDD Implementation ([TDD-1 Milestone](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1/milestone/5))
5. **BARE**: Migration to Bare ([BARE-1 Milestone](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1/milestone/6))
6. **NFD**: New Functionality Development (No formal milestone - cross-epic support)
7. **AVRO**: AVRO Integration ([AVRO-1 Milestone](https://github.com/SPlectrum/spl1/milestone/8))

## Planning Resources

- **Epic Details**: See [spl1 Epics Overview](./spl1-epics-overview.md) for epic descriptions and scope
- **Phase Strategy**: See [Phase-Based Development Strategy](./phase-based-development-strategy.md) 
- **Issue Management**: See `workflows/GITHUB_WORKFLOW.md` for issue lifecycle
- **Project Automation**: See `workflows/PROJECT_AUTOMATION.md` for automated management

## Implementation Sequence

**Current Focus**: Complete Version 0.6.1 planning baseline across all epics
**Next Phase**: Transition to Version 0.6.1+ implementation work
**Strategic Foundation**: SE-1 container pioneer approach enables broader platform containerization

## Learning Capture

**All development learnings are captured in**: `logs/learnings.md`

This replaces traditional roadmap planning with issue-driven development supported by automated project management and strategic documentation.
