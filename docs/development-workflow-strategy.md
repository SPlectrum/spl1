# Development Workflow Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for optimizing AI-assisted development workflows in the SPlectrum project, focusing on repository organization, context management, and test-driven development practices.

## Multi-Repository Architecture Plan

### Target Repository Structure

```
spl-core/           # Execution engine, data layer, packages
├── CLAUDE.md       # Core platform patterns
├── modules/spl/    # Core APIs
└── docs/

spl-apps/           # Applications (boot, test-suite, watcher)
├── CLAUDE.md       # App development patterns  
├── apps/           # Individual applications
└── docs/

spl-tools/          # External tool integrations
├── CLAUDE.md       # Tool integration patterns
├── modules/tools/  # Git, 7zip, etc.
└── docs/
```

### Benefits of Domain Separation

**Efficiency Gains**:
- Faster file searches and navigation in smaller codebases
- Focused CLAUDE.md files with domain-specific guidance
- Reduced cognitive overhead from irrelevant context
- Better tool performance on smaller file sets

**Context Management**:
- Clear domain boundaries and responsibilities
- Single domain expertise per repository
- Reduced risk of applying wrong patterns across domains
- Easier maintenance of specialized knowledge

## Context Management Strategy

### Interactive Mode → Context Switching

**When to Use**:
- Architecture decisions and complex debugging
- Learning new domain patterns
- Establishing new workflows
- Active collaboration sessions

**Characteristics**:
- Single Claude Code instance for collaborative work
- Manual repository switching as work requires
- Real-time guidance and feedback loops
- Shared context builds during collaboration

### Autonomous Mode → Multiple Instances

**When to Use**:
- Routine maintenance tasks
- Established workflows and patterns
- Documentation updates
- Independent parallel work streams

**Characteristics**:
- Dedicated instances per repository domain
- Deep specialized context per domain
- Parallel work streams possible
- Domain expertise builds over time

### Transition Strategy

**Phase-Based Approach**:
1. **Interactive Learning**: Start all new domains in interactive mode
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify routine vs complex tasks
3. **Selective Graduation**: Move proven workflows to autonomous mode
4. **Hybrid Operation**: Complex work stays interactive, routine becomes autonomous
5. **Regular Check-ins**: Periodic reviews of autonomous work streams

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach

### Core TDD Principles

**Objective Verification**:
- Clear pass/fail criteria rather than subjective assessment
- Automated verification reduces need for human oversight
- Self-correcting feedback loops for autonomous operation
- Understanding requirements before implementation

### Test Categories

**1. Unit Tests**:
- Individual module functionality verification
- API method parameter validation
- Return value correctness
- Error handling behavior

**2. Integration Tests**:
- API interactions between modules
- Package deployment processes
- Cross-module data flow
- Configuration loading and validation

**3. System Tests**:
- Full release/deployment cycle validation
- End-to-end application workflows
- Multi-application integration
- Performance and scalability verification

**4. State Tests**:
- Repository cleanliness verification
- File pattern compliance checking
- Deployment artifact validation
- Configuration consistency across environments

### Testing Toolkit Development

**Verification Scripts**:
- Boot app deployment validation (verify only .batch files in release)
- API development test automation
- Cross-repo dependency verification
- Release process integrity checks

**Test Harnesses**:
- Complex workflow automation
- Multi-step process validation
- Error injection and recovery testing
- Performance benchmarking

**Status Check Commands**:
- Repository health verification
- Configuration validation
- Dependency status checking
- Build and deployment status

**Regression Testing Suites**:
- Automated test execution
- Historical comparison validation
- Breaking change detection
- Performance regression identification

### TDD Workflow Integration

**Development Cycle**:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand what needs to be accomplished
2. **Test Design**: Create test cases to verify success criteria
3. **Implementation**: Build features to pass the tests
4. **Verification**: Execute tests to confirm correctness
5. **Iteration**: Debug and fix until all tests pass

**Documentation Requirements**:
- Test procedures in repository CLAUDE.md files
- Test case documentation for complex scenarios
- Automated test execution instructions
- Troubleshooting guides for common test failures

### Benefits for Autonomous Operation

**Confidence Building**:
- Clear success criteria enable confident independent work
- Objective measurements replace subjective evaluation
- Automated validation provides immediate feedback
- Pattern recognition improves through test-driven learning

**Quality Assurance**:
- Consistent verification across all work products
- Early detection of issues before human review
- Reduced iteration cycles through self-correction
- Improved reliability of autonomous workflows

**Scalability**:
- Repeatable processes for routine tasks
- Standardized verification across repositories
- Knowledge transfer through documented test cases
- Reduced dependency on human oversight

## Implementation Roadmap
