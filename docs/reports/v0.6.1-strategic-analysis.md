## Process Improvement Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Address 35 workflows with low completion rates
1. Investigate SESSION_START workflow issues

### Strategic Opportunities
- Replicate characteristics of 5 highly productive sessions
- Target productivity score of 22.6 for future sessions

## Future Version Guidance

### Recommended Focus Areas
- **documentation**: High activity (10 instances) suggests continued importance

### Process Evolution Recommendations
1. **Workflow Standardization**: Formalize successful patterns identified in analysis
2. **Component Coupling Management**: Address high co-modification patterns for better modularity
3. **Session Optimization**: Target characteristics of highly productive sessions
4. **Knowledge Domain Balance**: Ensure adequate coverage of all engaged domains
