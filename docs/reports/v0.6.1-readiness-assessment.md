## Readiness Criteria Assessment

**Categories Passed**: 2/4
**Overall Readiness**: 60.0%

### ❌ Preparation Incomplete
Some validation checks have failed. Address the required actions above before proceeding with next version development.

## VERSION_TRANSITION Integration

This readiness assessment validates that:
- **Close Version Workflow** completed audit cleanup and system reset
- **NEW_VERSION_PLANNING Workflow** completed scope and priority definition
- **Version references** are consistently updated across documentation
- **Knowledge management systems** are ready for new version development

### Next Steps
1. **Address Issues**: Complete required actions listed above
2. **Re-run Validation**: Execute readiness assessment again
3. **Escalate Blockers**: Resolve any persistent preparation issues
