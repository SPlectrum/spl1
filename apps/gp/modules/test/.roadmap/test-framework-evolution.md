# SPL Test Framework Evolution Roadmap

## Vision
Transform the SPL test framework from basic discovery to a fully autonomous, self-diagnosing test system that drives implementation quality through natural audit integration.

## Current State (Baseline)
- ✅ Basic discovery system with pattern matching
- ✅ Test file naming convention: `{type}__{target}__{description}.json`
- ✅ Hierarchical test placement at minimum scope (`.test` directories)
- ✅ SPL pipeline integration (`discover @@ report`)
- ✅ Foundation for XPath selector evolution

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Test Execution (Interactive Foundation)
**Goal**: Execute basic tests with manual audit inspection

#### Milestones:
- **M1.1**: Implement `gp/test/run` for basic test execution
  - Parse `basic__*` test files
  - Execute test actions via SPL pipeline  
  - Capture success/failure states
  - Generate workspace keys from execution context

- **M1.2**: Interactive Audit Integration
  - Tests run with global `-d` flag for full audit capture
  - Manual inspection of audit logs for test results
  - Document patterns of successful vs failed test audit entries
  - Identify gaps in current error data placement

- **M1.3**: Basic Test Assertion Engine
  - Implement workspace state checking
  - History pattern matching for success indicators
  - Error detection and classification
  - Simple pass/fail reporting

#### Success Criteria:
- Can run `basic__gp_fs_write__first-tests` successfully
- Audit log contains all necessary diagnostic information
- Test failures provide workspace key for deep inspection

### Phase 2: Intelligent Error Handling (System Enhancement)
**Goal**: Enhance SPL error handling to support autonomous test diagnosis

#### Milestones:
- **M2.1**: Error Data Restructuring
  - Move error information from top-level to appropriate workspace locations
  - Ensure test-relevant error context is workspace-accessible
  - Standardize error data structures across SPL operations

- **M2.2**: Test-Driven Audit Enhancement
  - Implement automatic error context capture for test executions
  - Create workspace key linking mechanism for test runs
  - Develop error classification patterns based on test requirements

- **M2.3**: Self-Contained Failure Messages
  - Tests return minimal failure messages with workspace keys
  - Implement hint system for test nature and failure patterns
  - All technical details remain in audit log under natural keys

#### Success Criteria:
- Test failures are self-diagnosing via audit log references
- Error information is properly encapsulated in workspace data
- No duplication between test messages and audit log

### Phase 3: Advanced Discovery & Validation (Quality Enforcement)
**Goal**: Evolve discovery system to enforce coding standards and validate system integrity

#### Milestones:
- **M3.1**: XPath Selector Implementation
  - Replace basic pattern matching with XPath-like syntax
  - Enable complex structural queries: `//test[contains(@name,'basic__')]`
  - Support validation patterns: `/apps/*/modules/*/.test/*.json`

- **M3.2**: Coding Standards Enforcement
  - Validate naming convention compliance across codebase
  - Check directory structure standards (`.test` placement, etc.)
  - Detect deviations from established patterns
  - Generate compliance reports

- **M3.3**: Cross-Reference Analysis
  - Find tests without corresponding implementations
  - Identify implementations lacking test coverage
  - Dependency analysis between modules, tests, and documentation
  - Integration validation across SPL components

#### Success Criteria:
- Discovery system enforces coding standards automatically
- XPath selectors enable complex structural analysis
- Quality gates prevent non-compliant code introduction

### Phase 4: Autonomous Test Ecosystem (Production Ready)
**Goal**: Fully self-contained test system with intelligent reporting and remediation guidance

#### Milestones:
- **M4.1**: Autonomous Test Runner
  - Headless test execution with comprehensive reporting
  - Parallel test execution with isolation guarantees
  - Test result aggregation and trend analysis
  - Performance regression detection

- **M4.2**: Intelligent Remediation System
  - Automated failure pattern recognition
  - Context-aware remediation suggestions
  - Learning system that improves diagnosis over time
  - Integration with development workflow automation

- **M4.3**: Production Quality Gates
  - Pre-commit test validation hooks
  - Continuous integration test pipeline
  - Release readiness assessment automation
  - Quality metrics dashboard and alerting

#### Success Criteria:
- Tests run autonomously without human intervention
- Intelligent failure diagnosis with actionable remediation
- Production deployments protected by comprehensive quality gates
