# Development Learnings Log (spl1 v0.6.2)

*This log captures key insights and learnings from development sessions to inform future work and document architectural decisions.*

**Version Archiving**: This log must be archived when creating new versions/releases following the same pattern as timelog archiving - archive to `/logs/archive/learnings_v<version>.md` before git tagging new versions.

**Previous Version Learnings**: See `logs/archive/` for complete historical learning documentation.

## Version 0.6.2 Development Cycle

### Session End Learnings

**Release Process Maturation (2025-06-20)**
- Successfully executed first systematic "release sesame" workflow for v0.6.1
- Identified critical distinction between planning and implementation releases
- Created comprehensive release notes template with milestone-based structure
- Established systematic log archiving with version stamps for historical preservation
- Documented workflow evolution strategy for continuous process improvement

**Key Insights**:
- Planning releases focus on architectural documentation without binary artifacts
- Implementation releases require tested binary packages and user-focused deliverables
- Release notes should serve as permanent record when GitHub Projects are archived
- Systematic version transition requires defined new version initial activities

**Process Improvements Documented**:
- Template-based release notes generation ensures comprehensive coverage
- Project management integration patterns for milestone tracking
- Version strategy guidelines with clear release criteria
- Workflow evolution documentation for continuous improvement

**Next Version Preparation**:
- Added "New Version Initial Activities" to repository todo list
- Need for systematic version startup workflow including log review and project creation
- Transition from v0.6.1 planning phase to v0.6.2 implementation phase ready
