*This log captures key insights and learnings from development sessions to inform future work and document architectural decisions.*

**Version Archiving**: This log must be archived when creating new versions/releases following the same pattern as timelog archiving - archive to `/logs/archive/learnings_v<version>.md` before git tagging new versions.
