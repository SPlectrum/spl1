## Context-Specific Keywords (Future)

Potential additional workflow triggers:

| Context | Potential Keywords | Purpose |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Debugging | DEBUG_WORKFLOW | Systematic debugging approach |
| Testing | TESTING_WORKFLOW | Test creation and execution |
| Documentation | DOCS_WORKFLOW | Documentation standards |
| Learning | LEARNING_CAPTURE | End-of-session learning documentation |

## Sesame Alias System

The **sesame suffix** provides user-friendly triggers for workflow keywords:

- **Pattern**: `[descriptive_word] sesame` → `WORKFLOW_KEYWORD`
- **Magic word**: "sesame" (reference to "Open Sesame" - opens workflow execution)
- **Usage**: Users type friendly aliases, system maps to technical keywords
- **Timelog**: Always records technical keywords for consistency

### Sesame Alias Mapping

```
start sesame     → SESSION_START
finish sesame    → SESSION_END  
git sesame       → GIT_WORKFLOW
github sesame    → GITHUB_WORKFLOW
rules sesame     → OPERATIONAL_RULES
commands sesame  → ESSENTIAL_COMMANDS
release sesame   → RELEASE_PROCESS
planning sesame  → PLANNED_VS_UNPLANNED
project sesame   → PROJECT_AUTOMATION
next sesame      → NEXT_ISSUE
recommend sesame → WORKFLOW_RECOMMENDATION
```

## Registry Maintenance Rules

1. **Add new keywords here FIRST** before creating workflow files
2. **Update this registry** when modifying existing workflows
3. **Check for conflicts** - ensure keywords are unique and clear
4. **Follow naming convention**: NOUN_VERB or CONTEXT_ACTION format
5. **Keep alphabetical order** within each section for easy scanning
6. **Add sesame alias** for all new workflow keywords using descriptive, memorable words

## Usage Pattern

```markdown
**KEYWORD_NAME** → See [workflows/FILENAME.md](./workflows/FILENAME.md)
```

Example:
```markdown
**SESSION_START** → See [workflows/SESSION_START.md](./workflows/SESSION_START.md)
```
