# Repository Maintenance Analysis Plan

## Overview

**Purpose**: VERSION_TRANSITION Step 3 - Systematic repository maintenance and cleanup planning
**Output**: Detailed operational plan identifying specific maintenance tasks needed
**Execution**: Manual task execution based on generated analysis and recommendations

## Analysis Categories

### 1. Stale Information Detection

#### Outdated Version References
- **Scan Target**: All documentation files (`docs/`, `claude/`, README files)
- **Detection Criteria**:
  - Version numbers that don't match current version
  - References to "current version" that should be specific versions
  - Deprecated API or feature mentions
  - Outdated workflow references

#### Obsolete Documentation
- **Scan Target**: All `.md` files in repository
- **Detection Criteria**:
  - Files not modified in last 2+ versions
  - Documentation for removed features or tools
  - Superseded documentation (newer versions exist)
  - Experimental docs that became permanent features

#### Completed TODO/FIXME Comments
- **Scan Target**: All code and documentation files
- **Detection Criteria**:
  - TODO comments referencing completed features
  - FIXME comments for issues already resolved
  - Temporary markers that should be permanent
  - Development notes that are no longer relevant

### 2. File Reference Validation

#### Internal Link Checking
- **Scan Target**: All markdown files with internal links
- **Validation Tasks**:
  - Verify file paths exist at referenced locations
  - Check that anchors/headers exist in target files
  - Identify moved files that need path updates
  - Detect circular or redundant references

#### Cross-Reference Consistency
- **Scan Target**: Documentation with file/tool/workflow references
- **Validation Tasks**:
  - Ensure referenced tools actually exist
  - Verify workflow names match actual workflow files
  - Check that component references point to real components
  - Validate API documentation matches implementation

#### Path Structure Updates
- **Scan Target**: All files with relative or absolute path references
- **Update Tasks**:
  - Update paths changed during restructuring
  - Standardize path formats (relative vs absolute)
  - Fix references broken by file moves
  - Update deprecated path patterns

### 3. Temporary Content Management

#### Experimental Content Identification
- **Scan Target**: Files marked as experimental, draft, or temporary
- **Detection Criteria**:
  - Files with "experimental", "draft", "temp" in name/content
  - Proof-of-concept documentation
  - Test/example files that became permanent
  - Development notes that should be archived

#### Version-Specific Content
- **Scan Target**: Documentation with version-specific information
- **Management Tasks**:
  - Archive completed version-specific plans
  - Move outdated migration guides to archives
  - Preserve historical context while cleaning current docs
  - Identify content that should be generalized

#### Archive Organization
- **Target**: Content ready for archival
- **Organization Tasks**:
  - Create proper archive structure
  - Maintain historical context and accessibility
  - Ensure archived content is properly indexed
  - Remove temporary development artifacts

### 4. Documentation Consistency Validation

#### Terminology Standardization
- **Scan Target**: All documentation for terminology usage
- **Validation Tasks**:
  - Identify inconsistent naming patterns
  - Check for deprecated terminology usage
  - Ensure consistent capitalization and formatting
  - Validate technical term definitions are current

#### Pattern Compliance
- **Scan Target**: Documentation structure and formatting
- **Validation Tasks**:
  - Check adherence to established documentation patterns
  - Verify consistent markdown formatting
  - Ensure proper header hierarchy
  - Validate code block formatting and syntax

#### Cross-Documentation Integration
- **Scan Target**: Related documentation sets
- **Integration Tasks**:
  - Ensure complementary docs reference each other appropriately
  - Check for information duplication that should be consolidated
  - Verify workflow documentation matches implementation
  - Validate that all components are properly documented

## Implementation Approach

### Analysis Tool Structure
```
repository-maintenance-analyzer.js
├── staleContentAnalyzer()
├── fileReferenceValidator()
├── temporaryContentManager()
├── consistencyValidator()
└── generateMaintenanceReport()
```

### Output Report Format
**Generated File**: `docs/reports/v{VERSION}-repository-maintenance.md`

**Report Sections**:
1. **Executive Summary**: Overview of maintenance needs
2. **Stale Content Tasks**: Specific files and lines to update/remove
3. **Reference Fix Tasks**: Broken links and path updates needed
4. **Archive Tasks**: Files to move and archive organization needed
5. **Consistency Tasks**: Terminology and pattern fixes required
6. **Priority Classification**: High/Medium/Low priority for each task

### Task Execution Framework

#### High Priority Tasks
- Broken internal links that affect navigation
- Outdated version references in user-facing documentation
- References to non-existent tools or workflows

#### Medium Priority Tasks
- Terminology inconsistencies
- Experimental content that should be archived
- TODO/FIXME cleanup in non-critical areas

#### Low Priority Tasks
- Minor formatting inconsistencies
- Historical content organization
- Optional documentation enhancements

## Integration with VERSION_TRANSITION

### Input Requirements
- Completed version audit logs for context
- Current repository state analysis
- Knowledge of recent structural changes

### Output Integration
- Maintenance report feeds into Step 4 strategic analysis
- Completed maintenance improves repository quality metrics
- Clean repository state enables better Step 5 next version preparation

### Success Criteria
- All broken internal references identified and categorized
- Stale content clearly marked for removal or archival
- Temporary content properly organized for archival
- Specific, actionable task list with priority classifications
- Repository maintenance backlog reduced to manageable scope

## Future Automation Opportunities

### Automated Detection
- Link checking can be fully automated
- Version reference detection through pattern matching
- TODO/FIXME scanning with context analysis

### Semi-Automated Fixes
- Path updates with manual verification
- Terminology standardization with review
- Archive organization with human oversight

### Manual Review Required
- Content relevance and obsolescence determination
- Archive vs delete decisions
- Cross-documentation integration improvements
