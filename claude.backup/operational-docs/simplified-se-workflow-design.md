# Simplified SE Workflow Design: Core Robust Workflows

## Overview

Distillation of the complex SE workflow landscape into a minimal set of robust, high-impact workflows that cover all essential intervention patterns.

## Design Principles

### Simplicity Through Consolidation
- **Fewer workflows, broader scope**: Each workflow handles multiple related scenarios
- **Pattern-based design**: Workflows organized around intervention patterns, not specific technologies
- **Composable operations**: Workflows can be combined for complex scenarios
- **Clear boundaries**: No overlap between workflow responsibilities

### Robustness Through Generalization
- **Technology-agnostic**: Workflows handle git, GitHub, documentation, validation generically
- **Context-adaptive**: Same workflow adapts to different domains (code, docs, config)
- **Failure-resilient**: Built-in error handling and recovery patterns
- **Learning-enabled**: Workflows improve through intervention pattern recognition

## ⚠️ PARADIGM EVOLUTION: Data-Driven Trigger Architecture

### Revolutionary Insight: Pattern-Based Autonomous Execution

**Traditional Centralized Orchestration Problem:**
- Claude decides when to execute workflows
- Manual triggering creates cognitive overhead  
- Centralized coordination doesn't scale
- Sequential execution limits parallelism

**Data-Driven Trigger Solution:**
- **Data patterns trigger execution automatically**
- **SE processes execute when conditions are met**
- **Parallel, independent operation**
- **Claude designs trigger landscape, not execution timing**

### Core Architectural Shift

**From Command-Based:**
```bash
# Claude decides and commands
se orchestrate VERSION_TRANSITION --version 0.6.1
```

**To Pattern-Based:**
```json
// Data state triggers automatic execution
{
  "version": "0.6.1", 
  "release_state": "completed",
  "next_version": "uninitialized"
}
// → SE_VERSION_TRANSITION auto-executes
```

### Claude Role Transformation

**Current Role:** Workflow executor and orchestrator
**New Role:** Trigger landscape designer and intervention handler

**Responsibilities:**
- **Design trigger patterns** that reflect desired system behavior
- **Handle intervention queue** - smart interventions, error investigations
- **Maintain trigger landscape** - realign based on operational learning
- **Safety controls** - data-based kill switches and emergency overrides

### Safety Architecture

**Data-Based Kill Switches:**
```json
{
  "system_state": {
    "se_execution_enabled": true,
    "git_operations_enabled": true,
    "maintenance_mode": false
  }
}
```

**Emergency Overrides:**
```bash
se emergency-stop [--all | --workflow-type]
se force-intervention --workflow-id ABC123
```

### Evolutionary Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1:** Add data state tracking to existing workflows
**Phase 2:** Hybrid manual + automatic trigger operation  
**Phase 3:** Full data-driven trigger-based execution

**Evolution Example - SESSION_START:**
```
Current:    User: "start sesame" → Claude executes manually
Phase 1:    User: "start sesame" → Claude executes + updates state
Phase 2:    Manual OR pattern detection → Claude executes  
Phase 3:    session_state: "uninitialized" → SE auto-executes
```

## Core SE Workflow Set (4 Workflows)

### 1. SE_ORCHESTRATE → SE_TRIGGER_ENGINE
**Purpose:** Pattern detection and trigger-based workflow execution

**Evolution:** From manual orchestration to autonomous pattern-based execution

**Responsibilities:**
- Monitor data patterns for trigger conditions
- Execute SE workflows when patterns are detected
- Manage parallel, independent workflow execution
- Provide trigger landscape configuration interface

**Trigger Patterns (Examples):**
```json
{
  "SE_VERSION_TRANSITION": "release_state=='completed' && next_version=='uninitialized'",
  "SE_GIT_SYNC": "branch_behind_origin || uncommitted_changes",  
  "SE_AUDIT_ARCHIVE": "session_ended && current_log_has_entries",
  "SE_SESSION_START": "session_state=='uninitialized'"
}
```

**API Commands:**
```bash
se trigger-config --add PATTERN_NAME "condition_expression"
se trigger-status [--pattern PATTERN_NAME] [--all]
se trigger-disable PATTERN_NAME [--reason "maintenance"]

```

**Intervention Patterns:**
- **Conflicts**: Code merges, documentation conflicts, configuration clashes
- **Quality**: Generated content review, onboarding effectiveness, process optimization
- **Validation**: Test failures, compliance issues, dependency problems
- **Strategy**: Epic prioritization, phase planning, architecture decisions

### 3. SE_ANALYZE  
**Purpose:** Strategic analysis and planning operations

**Responsibilities:**
- Repository state analysis and health checks

## Simplified Workflow Interaction Patterns

### Primary SE API Interface
```bash
# Core Operations
se orchestrate WORKFLOW_NAME [options]     # Launch any SE workflow
se resolve --help                          # Handle any intervention request  
se analyze TARGET [scope]                  # Perform strategic analysis
se maintain SYSTEM [operations]            # Execute maintenance operations

# Meta Operations  
se status [--all]                          # Monitor all operations
se help [WORKFLOW_NAME]                    # Get workflow guidance
se config [--show|--set key=value]         # Configure SE behavior
```

### Unified Intervention Protocol
```bash
# SE requests help (any type)
se request-intervention --workflow-id ABC123 --type TYPE --context DETAILS --priority LEVEL

# Claude responds (unified pattern)
claude: [analysis and resolution]

# SE continues (unified response)
se continue-workflow ABC123 --status resolved|approved|directed [--modifications files]
```

### Cross-Workflow Coordination
```bash
# Complex operations spanning multiple workflows
se orchestrate VERSION_TRANSITION --dependencies AUDIT_ANALYSIS,REPOSITORY_MAINTENANCE
se orchestrate RELEASE_PROCESS --pre-analyze --post-maintain
```

---

## Claude Intervention Consolidation

### Single Intervention Workflow: RESOLVE
**Triggers all consolidated:**
- Merge conflicts → Domain knowledge application
- Content quality → Strategic assessment and improvement  
- Validation failures → Context analysis and recovery
- Strategic decisions → Planning and prioritization

**Unified Process:**
```
1. Context Analysis
   - Understand intervention request type and context
   - Gather relevant domain knowledge and constraints
   - Assess impact and priority level

2. Intelligence Application
   - Apply domain expertise (conflicts)
   - Apply strategic judgment (planning)
   - Apply quality standards (content)
   - Apply system knowledge (validation)

3. Resolution Delivery
   - Provide specific resolution guidance
   - Document reasoning for learning
   - Signal SE container for continuation
   - Monitor resolution effectiveness
```

### Meta-Workflow: ORCHESTRATE_INTELLIGENCE
**Daily Claude Operations:**
```
1. SE_STATUS_CHECK        # Monitor all active SE workflows (30 seconds)
2. RESOLVE_INTERVENTIONS  # Handle intervention requests (5-20 minutes)
3. STRATEGIC_GUIDANCE     # Provide planning and direction (10-30 minutes)
```

**Weekly Claude Operations:**
```
