# VERSION_TRANSITION Workflow

## ⚠️ MANDATORY VERSION TRANSITION ⚠️

**MANDATORY VERSION TRANSITION**: After any version release completion, Claude MUST execute this systematic transition workflow to process development knowledge and prepare for next version.

**Trigger**: Mandatory execution after RELEASE_PROCESS workflow completion

**Input**: Closed version audit logs in `audit/v{version}/`
**Output**: Updated knowledge base and clean next version preparation

## MANDATORY TRANSITION SEQUENCE:

### 1. Audit Log Analysis and Processing
- **Process Version Audit Data**: Analyze all files in `audit/v{version}/` for systematic knowledge extraction
- **Extract Knowledge Domains**: Generate frequency analysis of knowledge domains touched during version
- **Identify New Components**: Catalog new files, modules, and system areas discovered during development
- **Calculate Development Metrics**: Quantify time distribution, activity patterns, and workflow effectiveness

### 2. Knowledge Base Synchronization
- **Update Documentation**: Refresh all docs/ files with insights and new knowledge from version development
- **Enhance Onboarding Materials**: Update prerequisite requirements based on actual development experience
- **Document New Patterns**: Capture new development patterns, practices, and architectural insights discovered
- **Refresh Component Guides**: Update component interaction documentation with actual usage patterns

### 3. Repository Maintenance and Cleanup
- **Remove Stale Information**: Identify and remove outdated documentation, obsolete references, and unused files
- **Update File References**: Ensure all documentation references point to current file locations and structures
- **Archive Temporary Content**: Move experimental or version-specific content to appropriate archives
- **Validate Documentation Links**: Verify all cross-references and ensure documentation consistency

### 4. Version Metrics and Strategic Analysis
- **Generate Activity Overview**: Create comprehensive metrics of development activity across knowledge domains
- **Analyze Component Interactions**: Document which components were frequently modified together
- **Identify Process Improvements**: Extract insights about workflow effectiveness and development patterns
- **Create Strategic Summary**: Document version achievements, insights, and implications for future development

### 5. Next Version Preparation
- **Clean Current Audit**: Ensure `audit/current/` is empty and ready for next version activities
- **Update Version References**: Update all documentation to reflect new version context
- **Establish Version Scope**: Define focus areas and priorities based on previous version insights
- **Initialize Knowledge Tracking**: Prepare knowledge management systems for next version development

## Audit Log Processing Methodology

### Knowledge Domain Analysis
```bash
# Extract all knowledge domains from version audit logs
grep -o 'domains:\[[^]]*\]' audit/v{version}/*.log | 
cut -d'[' -f2 | cut -d']' -f1 | 
tr ',' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### Component Interaction Mapping
```bash
# Extract file interaction patterns
grep -o 'files:\[[^]]*\]' audit/v{version}/*.log |
cut -d'[' -f2 | cut -d']' -f1 |
tr ',' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

### Development Pattern Recognition
- **Workflow Frequency**: Identify most common workflow types and execution patterns
- **Time Distribution**: Analyze time spent across different knowledge domains
- **Component Hotspots**: Identify files and areas with highest modification frequency
- **Cross-Domain Activities**: Map activities that span multiple knowledge domains

## Documentation Update Strategy

### Systematic Documentation Review
1. **Architecture Documents**: Update with actual implementation patterns discovered
2. **API Documentation**: Refresh with real usage patterns and component interactions
3. **Development Guides**: Enhance with practical insights from version development
4. **Testing Documentation**: Update with testing patterns and validation approaches used

### Knowledge Base Evolution
1. **Prerequisites Assessment**: Update onboarding requirements based on actual development needs
2. **Component Complexity**: Document actual complexity levels discovered during development
3. **Integration Patterns**: Capture real integration approaches and successful strategies
4. **Common Pitfalls**: Document challenges and solutions discovered during version

### Stale Content Identification
1. **Outdated References**: Remove references to changed file locations or obsolete approaches
2. **Superseded Documentation**: Identify documentation replaced by better or more current versions
3. **Experimental Content**: Archive proof-of-concept documentation that's no longer relevant
4. **Broken Links**: Fix or remove documentation links that no longer point to valid content

## Version Metrics Generation

### Development Activity Metrics
- **Domain Distribution**: Percentage of time spent in each knowledge domain
- **Component Activity**: Frequency of modification by file/component
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Average time per workflow type and completion rates
- **Cross-Domain Correlation**: Which domains are frequently worked on together

### Strategic Insights Extraction
- **Architecture Evolution**: How architectural understanding changed during version
- **Process Effectiveness**: Which workflows and processes proved most/least effective
- **Knowledge Gaps**: Areas where additional documentation or training would help
- **Success Patterns**: Development approaches that consistently produced good results

### Quality Indicators
- **Documentation Completeness**: Coverage of all components and processes developed
- **Knowledge Transfer Readiness**: How well the version development would onboard new team members
- **Process Maturity**: Evolution of development practices and systematic approaches
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: Areas needing attention or refactoring in future versions

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### Post-RELEASE_PROCESS Integration
- VERSION_TRANSITION automatically triggered after successful RELEASE_PROCESS completion
- Processes closed version audit data moved by RELEASE_PROCESS
- Ensures knowledge management happens at natural version boundaries

### Pre-Development Integration
- Prepares clean knowledge base for next version development
- Establishes baseline understanding for new version work
- Ensures development starts with most current knowledge and prerequisites

### Continuous Knowledge Evolution
- Systematic knowledge capture and processing prevents knowledge debt
- Regular documentation updates keep knowledge base current and useful
- Historical analysis enables continuous improvement of development processes

## Success Criteria
