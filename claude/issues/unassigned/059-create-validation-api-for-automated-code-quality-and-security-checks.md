# Create validation API for automated code quality and security checks

## Problem Statement
AI agents need automated validation capabilities to ensure code quality, security, and consistency during development. Manual validation is time-consuming and error-prone. A comprehensive validation API would provide immediate feedback on syntax, security vulnerabilities, code conventions, and breaking changes, enabling AI agents to maintain high code quality throughout the development process.

## Required Work
Build `gp/validate` API with four core validation methods:
1. **syntax** - Multi-language syntax checking and linting
2. **security** - Security pattern validation and vulnerability detection
3. **conventions** - Code style and architectural pattern compliance
4. **breaking** - Breaking change detection across code modifications

## Work Plan

### **1. API Structure**
```
spl-dev/apps/gp/
└── validate/
    ├── syntax/            # Syntax checking and linting
    ├── security/          # Security vulnerability detection
    ├── conventions/       # Code style and pattern compliance
    └── breaking/          # Breaking change analysis
```

### **2. Method Implementations**

#### **`gp/validate/syntax`**
- **Purpose**: Multi-language syntax validation and linting
- **Implementation**:
  - ESLint, JSHint for JavaScript
  - Pylint, Flake8 for Python
  - Language-specific parsers and validators
  - Custom rule configuration
- **Output**: Structured error/warning reports with fix suggestions
- **Example**: `[app]/validate/syntax --file=auth.js --rules=strict --fix-suggestions`

#### **`gp/validate/security`**
- **Purpose**: Security vulnerability and pattern detection
- **Implementation**:
  - ESLint security plugins
  - Bandit for Python security
  - Custom regex patterns for common vulnerabilities
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Output**: Security report with severity levels and remediation advice
- **Example**: `[app]/validate/security --scan-deps --report-level=medium --remediation`

#### **`gp/validate/conventions`**
- **Purpose**: Code style and architectural pattern compliance
- **Implementation**:
  - Prettier, StandardJS for formatting
  - Custom pattern matching for project conventions
  - Integration with gp/analyze for pattern detection
  - Configurable rule sets
- **Output**: Compliance report with suggested improvements
- **Example**: `[app]/validate/conventions --check=naming,structure --auto-format`

#### **`gp/validate/breaking`**
- **Purpose**: Breaking change detection and impact analysis
- **Implementation**:
  - API surface comparison
  - Integration with gp/analyze/dependencies
  - Semantic versioning guidance
  - Change impact assessment
- **Output**: Breaking change report with migration suggestions
- **Example**: `[app]/validate/breaking --compare=main --impact-analysis --migration-hints`

### **3. Intelligence Features**
- **Context-aware rules**: Validation rules adapt to project type and patterns
- **Severity prioritization**: Focus on critical issues first
- **Fix suggestions**: Automated suggestions for common issues
- **Integration**: Works with gp/analyze for deeper code understanding

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Syntax Validation**: Accurate syntax checking for JavaScript, Python, and other common languages
- [ ] **Security Scanning**: Detection of common security vulnerabilities and patterns
- [ ] **Convention Checking**: Validation of code style and architectural patterns
- [ ] **Breaking Change Detection**: Identification of API changes that break compatibility
- [ ] **Structured Output**: All validation results in JSON format with severity levels
- [ ] **Fix Suggestions**: Actionable recommendations for addressing validation issues
- [ ] **Performance**: Validation completes quickly for typical file sizes
- [ ] **Configurable Rules**: Support for project-specific validation rules
- [ ] **Integration**: Seamless integration with other gp APIs (analyze, search)

## Technical Considerations
- **Tool Integration**: Wrapper architecture around existing linting/validation tools
- **Rule Configuration**: Flexible rule system supporting project-specific requirements
- **Performance**: Caching validation results, incremental validation for large files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of malformed code and validation tool failures
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture for adding new validation types
- **Security**: Sandboxed execution of validation tools, safe handling of user code
- **Dependencies**: Management of multiple language-specific validation tools
- **Output Standardization**: Consistent JSON schema across all validation types
