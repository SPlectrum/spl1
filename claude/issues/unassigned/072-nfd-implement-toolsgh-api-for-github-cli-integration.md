## Epic
NFD - New Functionality Development

## Summary
Create a tools/gh API module following the established patterns of tools/7zip and tools/git to provide programmatic access to GitHub CLI functionality within the SPL ecosystem.

## Requirements
- Follow existing tools API patterns (tools/7zip, tools/git)
- Implement core gh commands: issue, pr, release, repo operations
- Support argument passing and error handling
- Include proper JSON argument schemas
- Provide comprehensive method coverage for GitHub operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API structure matches tools/git and tools/7zip patterns
- [ ] Core gh commands implemented and tested
- [ ] Argument schemas defined
- [ ] Integration with SPL app framework
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Related Issues
- Enhances #25 (GitHub Projects automation system) - tools/gh API would enable enhanced project automation capabilities

## Implementation Notes
This supports cross-epic automation and workflow improvements, particularly for release management and project coordination. The tools/gh API will enable enhanced automation of the project management system implemented in #25.
