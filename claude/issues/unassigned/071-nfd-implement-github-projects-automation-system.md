## Epic
NFD - New Functionality Development

## Summary
Create programmatic GitHub Projects management system to automate decision-making workflows, field population, and project configuration. This enables scalable project management without manual overhead.

## Implementation Complete âœ…
- Created  with GraphQL API integration
- Added custom fields: Session Type, Decision Score, Context Switch Cost
- Implemented decision algorithm for "what next" recommendations
- Built automated field configuration for all issues

## Current Features
- **Automated Configuration**: Bulk set decision-making field values
- **Smart Recommendations**: Analyze project data for next action suggestions  
- **Version-Focused**: Prioritize current version (0.6.1) analysis work
- **Scalable**: GraphQL API automation, eliminates manual project management

## Commands Available
```bash
node status/project-automation.js configure   # Set up all field values
node status/project-automation.js recommend   # Get next action suggestions  
node status/project-automation.js info        # Project structure inspection
```

## Decision Score Algorithm
- **Analysis/Planning (0.6.1)**: Score 85 (high priority)
- **Infrastructure/Tools**: Score 75 (enables other work)  
- **Implementation (0.6.2+)**: Score 60 (future focus)

## Dependencies
- Relates to #24 (tools/gh API) - this system could be enhanced with gh API integration
- Enables optimal decision-making for all future development work

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] GraphQL API integration functional
- [x] Custom fields created and populated
- [x] Decision algorithm implemented
- [x] Recommendation system working
- [ ] Integration with tools/gh API (#24) for enhanced automation
- [ ] Documentation for project management workflow

## Next Steps
- Test field population via configure command
- Integrate with daily workflow decision-making
- Consider enhancement via tools/gh API when #24 is implemented
