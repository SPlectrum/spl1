# Implement Test Prerequisites System for Basic Test Framework

## Problem Statement
The basic test framework can execute API tests but lacks the ability to set up required test conditions such as existing files, directories, or specific file content. Currently, tests that require existing files (like gp/fs/read or gp/fs/copy) cannot be properly tested because there's no mechanism to ensure prerequisite files exist before test execution.

This limitation prevents comprehensive API testing and makes tests fragile, as they depend on manual setup or previous test side effects.

## Required Work
Implement a **test prerequisites system** that can:
- **Setup Phase**: Create required files, directories, and content before test execution
- **Teardown Phase**: Clean up test artifacts after test completion
- **Validation Phase**: Verify prerequisites were created successfully
- **Integration**: Work seamlessly with existing `gp/test` pipeline (discover/plan/run/report)

## Work Plan

### Phase 1: Prerequisites Schema Design
1. **Extend Test JSON Structure**
   ```json
   {
     "key": "basic__gp_fs_read__with-prerequisites",
     "prerequisites": [
       {
         "type": "file",
         "action": "create", 
         "path": "test-read.txt",
         "content": "Test content for reading"
       },
       {
         "type": "directory",
         "action": "create",
         "path": "test-folder"
       }
     ],
     "tests": [...],
     "cleanup": [
       {
         "type": "file",
         "action": "remove",
         "path": "test-read.txt"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Prerequisites Actions**
   - **file/create**: Create file with specified content
   - **file/copy**: Copy existing file to test location
   - **directory/create**: Create directory structure
   - **directory/copy**: Copy directory tree
   - **workspace/set**: Pre-populate workspace data

### Phase 2: Prerequisites Engine Implementation
1. **Prerequisites Processor** (`test/prerequisites.js`)
   ```javascript
   exports.setupPrerequisites = function(testDefinition, workspace) {
     // Process prerequisites array and create required conditions
   };
   
   exports.cleanupPrerequisites = function(testDefinition, workspace) {
     // Remove test artifacts based on cleanup array
   };
   ```

2. **Integration with Test Runner**
   - Modify `gp/test/run` to execute prerequisites before tests
   - Add cleanup after test completion
   - Handle prerequisite failures gracefully

### Phase 3: Session-Based Isolation Integration
1. **Workspace Integration**: Use session data directory for isolated test files
2. **Path Resolution**: Resolve prerequisite paths relative to test workspace
3. **Error Handling**: Provide clear messages for prerequisite failures

### Phase 4: Enhanced Test Definitions
1. **Create comprehensive test suites** using prerequisites:
   - `gp/fs/read` tests with existing files
   - `gp/fs/copy` tests with source files
   - `gp/fs/move` tests with directory structures
   - API chain tests with multi-step prerequisites

## Acceptance Criteria

**Prerequisites Setup**:
- [ ] Test JSON supports `prerequisites` array with file/directory creation actions
- [ ] Prerequisites processor creates files with specified content before test execution
- [ ] Directory structure creation works correctly including nested paths
- [ ] Workspace data can be pre-populated as prerequisites

**Test Integration**:
- [ ] `gp/test/run` executes prerequisites before running individual tests
- [ ] Test execution continues normally after successful prerequisite setup
- [ ] Failed prerequisites abort test execution with clear error messages
- [ ] Prerequisites work correctly in pipeline execution with workspace persistence

**Cleanup System**:
- [ ] `cleanup` array in test JSON specifies teardown actions
- [ ] Cleanup executes after test completion (success or failure)
- [ ] Test artifacts are completely removed from workspace
- [ ] Cleanup failures are logged but don't fail the overall test

**Enhanced Testing Capabilities**:
- [ ] gp/fs/read tests can read from pre-created files
- [ ] gp/fs/copy tests can copy existing files to new locations
- [ ] Multi-step tests can build on previous test outputs
- [ ] Complex API workflows can be tested with full setup/teardown

**Session Integration**:
- [ ] Prerequisites respect session-based data directory configuration
- [ ] Isolated test workspaces work correctly with prerequisites
- [ ] Prerequisites don't interfere with concurrent test execution

## Technical Considerations
- **Path Safety**: Ensure prerequisite paths are confined to test workspace
- **Performance**: Minimize file I/O overhead for large prerequisite sets
- **Error Recovery**: Handle partial prerequisite failures gracefully
- **Concurrency**: Support parallel test execution with isolated prerequisites
- **Workspace Integration**: Align with existing SPL workspace and API record patterns

## Usage Examples

**Basic File Prerequisites**:
```json
{
  "key": "basic__gp_fs_read__existing-file",
  "prerequisites": [
    {
      "type": "file",
      "action": "create",
      "path": "sample.txt", 
      "content": "Hello World"
    }
  ],
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "read existing file",
      "action": "gp/fs/read",
      "params": {"file": "sample.txt"},
      "expect": {
        "workspace": "contains 'Hello World'",
        "error": "none"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Directory Structure Prerequisites**:
```json
{
  "prerequisites": [
    {
      "type": "directory",
      "action": "create",
      "path": "test-dir/nested"
    },
    {
      "type": "file", 
      "action": "create",
      "path": "test-dir/config.json",
      "content": "{\"setting\": \"value\"}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration Points
- **gp/test/run**: Main integration point for prerequisite execution
- **Session Data Management**: Use isolated workspaces for test file creation
- **Workspace API**: Store prerequisite metadata in test workspace records
- **Error Handling**: Integrate with existing test failure reporting

## Success Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Enable testing of APIs that require existing files/directories
- **Test Reliability**: Eliminate dependency on manual setup or test ordering
- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce time spent on test environment preparation
- **System Quality**: Enable comprehensive API validation with realistic scenarios
