# Implement File-Based Test Reporting with Failed Test Audit Dumps

## Problem Statement
The current test framework provides basic pass/fail reporting but lacks persistent test results and diagnostic information for failed tests. When tests fail, developers need access to comprehensive audit logs to understand what went wrong and how to fix issues. Manual investigation is time-consuming and doesn't scale for automated testing scenarios.

## Required Work
Create a comprehensive test reporting system that:
- **Generates persistent test reports** written to files for historical analysis
- **Attaches complete audit dumps** for failed tests to enable autonomous debugging
- **Provides structured report formats** suitable for both human consumption and automated processing
- **Integrates seamlessly** with existing gp/test framework and SPL audit system

## Work Plan

### Phase 1: Basic File-Based Reporting
1. **Implement report file generation**
   - Create standardized report file naming: `test-report-{timestamp}.json`
   - Store reports in `.test-reports/` directories at appropriate scope levels
   - Include test execution metadata, timing, and summary statistics

2. **Design report data structure**
   ```json
   {
     "report_id": "test-report-2025-08-07T07:20:00.123Z",
     "execution": {
       "timestamp": "2025-08-07T07:20:00.123Z",
       "duration_ms": 1234,
       "command": "gp/test/run --modules='gp/fs/write'"
     },
     "summary": {
       "total_tests": 5,
       "passed": 3,
       "failed": 2,
       "skipped": 0
     },
     "results": [
       {
         "test_key": "basic__gp_fs_write__first-tests",
         "status": "passed|failed|skipped",
         "duration_ms": 234,
         "workspace_key": "execution-specific-key",
         "audit_reference": "audit-section-reference"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Implement basic report writer**
   - Create `gp/test/report/write` module
   - Generate reports from test execution data
   - Handle concurrent test execution scenarios

### Phase 2: Failed Test Audit Integration
1. **Audit dump extraction**
   - Identify audit log sections relevant to failed tests
   - Extract complete execution context for failed test cases
   - Include workspace state, error details, and execution trace

2. **Audit attachment mechanism**
   ```json
   {
     "test_key": "basic__gp_fs_write__first-tests",
     "status": "failed",
     "error_summary": "File creation unsuccessful",
     "workspace_key": "natural-execution-key",
     "audit_dump": {
       "execution_trace": [...],
       "workspace_state": {...},
       "error_context": {...},
       "timing_info": {...}
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Selective audit capture**
   - Only attach audit dumps for failed tests (avoid bloating successful test reports)
   - Implement audit log filtering to include only relevant entries
   - Provide audit dump size optimization for large execution contexts

### Phase 3: Advanced Reporting Features
1. **Multiple report formats**
   - JSON for automated processing
   - HTML for human-readable reports with audit log visualization
   - CSV/TSV for spreadsheet analysis
   - Markdown for documentation integration

2. **Report aggregation and analysis**
   - Historical test result comparison
   - Trend analysis for test reliability
   - Performance regression detection
   - Failed test pattern analysis

3. **Integration with development workflow**
   - Pre-commit hooks for test result validation
   - CI/CD pipeline integration points
   - Automated report distribution mechanisms

## Acceptance Criteria

**Basic Reporting**:
- [ ] Test execution generates persistent report files with structured data
- [ ] Report files include all test results, timing, and execution metadata
- [ ] Reports are written to appropriate `.test-reports/` directories
- [ ] Report file naming follows consistent timestamp-based convention

**Failed Test Audit Integration**:
- [ ] Failed tests automatically include complete audit dumps in reports
- [ ] Audit dumps contain all necessary diagnostic information for debugging
- [ ] Audit attachment is selective (only for failures) to manage report size
- [ ] Workspace keys properly link test failures to audit log sections

**Usability & Integration**:
- [ ] Reports are human-readable and machine-processable
- [ ] Integration with existing `gp/test/run` workflow requires no additional commands
- [ ] Report generation performance doesn't significantly impact test execution time
- [ ] Multiple report formats available for different consumption scenarios

**Quality & Reliability**:
- [ ] Report generation handles concurrent test execution without conflicts
- [ ] Failed audit dump extraction is robust across different error scenarios
- [ ] Report file storage is organized and doesn't accumulate indefinitely
- [ ] Error handling ensures report generation failures don't break test execution

## Technical Considerations
- **Performance**: Audit dump extraction should be optimized to avoid impacting test execution
- **Storage**: Implement report retention policies to manage disk space usage
- **Security**: Ensure audit dumps don't expose sensitive information inappropriately
- **Scalability**: Design report structure to handle large test suites efficiently
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing gp/test functionality during integration

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Run tests with automatic report generation
./spl_execute dev gp/test/run --modules="gp/fs" --report

# Generate report from previous test execution
./spl_execute dev gp/test/report --source="last-run" --format="html"

# View failed test audit details
./spl_execute dev gp/test/report --test-key="basic__gp_fs_write__first-tests" --show-audit
```

## Integration Points
- **gp/test/run**: Automatic report generation after test execution
- **gp/test/report**: Enhanced reporting with file output options
- **SPL Audit System**: Seamless integration for audit dump extraction
- **Development Workflow**: Optional integration with git hooks and CI/CD

## Success Metrics
- **Developer Efficiency**: Reduced time from test failure to problem identification
- **Test Coverage**: Improved test result analysis and historical tracking capability
- **System Quality**: Enhanced debugging capability through comprehensive audit integration
- **Automation Readiness**: Foundation for autonomous test result processing

## GitHub Discussion Summary
This issue emerged from collaborative design sessions focused on evolving the SPL test framework from basic discovery to autonomous quality enforcement. The file-based reporting system represents a critical milestone in enabling scalable, persistent test result analysis with integrated diagnostic capabilities.
