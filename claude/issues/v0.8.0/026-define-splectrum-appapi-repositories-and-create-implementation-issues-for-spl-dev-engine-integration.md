# Define splectrum app/api repositories and create implementation issues for spl-dev engine integration

## Problem Statement
Define the specific splectrum application and API repositories that need to be created to demonstrate and validate the spl-dev engine functionality. This issue serves as a planning and coordination task that will be executed once the spl-dev engine has sufficient operational capabilities.

## Required Work
**Phase 1: Repository Definition**
- Analyze current spl1 functionality to identify app/api separation boundaries
- Define the initial batch of splectrum app repositories following `splectrum/[app]_[api]` pattern
- Specify dependencies and integration points with carambah/spl-dev engine

**Phase 2: Issue Creation**
- Create individual implementation issues for each defined app/api repository
- Establish dependency relationships and implementation order
- Define acceptance criteria for spl-dev engine integration

## Work Plan

### 1. App/API Repository Analysis
Identify logical separation boundaries in current spl1:
```
splectrum/[app]_[api] structure candidates:
├── splectrum/core_api          # Core SPlectrum functionality
├── splectrum/workflow_app      # Development workflow management
├── splectrum/audit_api         # Audit logging and metrics
├── splectrum/issue_app         # Issue management system
├── splectrum/transition_api    # Version transition management
├── splectrum/cli_app           # Command-line interface
└── splectrum/docs_app          # Documentation system
```

### 2. Repository Definition Specifications
For each identified repository:
- **Purpose**: Clear functional scope and responsibilities
- **spl-dev Integration**: How it consumes the carambah/spl-dev engine
- **Dependencies**: Required modules from spl-dev and external dependencies
- **Interfaces**: API contracts and integration points
- **Examples**: Reference implementations and usage patterns

### 3. Implementation Issue Creation
Create individual issues for:
- Repository structure setup
- spl-dev engine integration
- Core functionality implementation
- Testing and validation
- Documentation and examples

### 4. Coordination Framework
- **Dependency Mapping**: Clear prerequisites between repositories
- **Implementation Order**: Logical sequence for development
- **Integration Testing**: Cross-repository validation approach
- **Release Coordination**: Version alignment with spl-dev releases

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Repository List Defined**: Complete specification of splectrum app/api repositories to be created
- [ ] **Integration Specifications**: Clear definition of how each repo uses spl-dev engine
- [ ] **Dependency Mapping**: Dependencies between repositories and spl-dev modules documented
- [ ] **Implementation Issues Created**: Individual issues created for each app/api repository
- [ ] **Development Order Established**: Logical implementation sequence defined
- [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Cross-repository integration testing approach specified
- [ ] **Documentation Framework**: Template structure for app/api repository documentation
- [ ] **Success Metrics**: Criteria for validating spl-dev engine operational readiness

## Technical Considerations
- **Engine Readiness**: Waits for sufficient spl-dev functionality (depends on issue #025)
- **Architecture Consistency**: All repositories follow consistent patterns and interfaces
- **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns between app/api repositories
- **Scalability**: Repository structure supports future expansion
- **Testing**: Integration testing across multiple repositories
- **Documentation**: Consistent documentation patterns for developers

## Dependencies
- **Blocks**: Creation of individual splectrum app/api repositories
- **Blocked by**: carambah/spl-dev engine operational functionality (issue #025)
- **Related**: Seed-to-split work plan (issue #013)
