# Implement single execution point at root of spl install with unified context management

## Problem Statement
Currently, spl installs have multiple execution points distributed across individual apps, creating complexity and inconsistency. Each app has its own execution context, making it difficult to manage unified execution scope and command routing. Need a single execution point at the root of spl install that can intelligently route commands based on context.

## Required Work
Implement a unified execution architecture with:
- Single execution point at spl install root
- Remove existing individual app execution points
- Context-aware command routing for [app]/[api]/[method] patterns
- Pure module command context definition
- Internal-only execution scope

## Work Plan

### Phase 1: Architecture Design
- Define unified execution point interface
- Design context resolution logic for command patterns
- Plan migration strategy from distributed to centralized execution

### Phase 2: Context Management System
- Implement [app]/[api]/[method] command parsing
- Create app context execution environment
- Define pure module command context resolution
- Ensure spl-internal-only execution scope

### Phase 3: Migration and Cleanup
- Remove existing app-level execution points
- Migrate existing functionality to unified system
- Update documentation and usage patterns

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Test all command routing scenarios
- Validate context isolation and security
- Performance testing for execution overhead

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Single execution point implemented at spl install root
- [ ] All existing app execution points removed
- [ ] [app]/[api]/[method] commands execute within correct app context
- [ ] Pure module commands execute with properly defined context
- [ ] Execution scope limited to spl-internal only
- [ ] Command routing works for all existing functionality
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (<10ms overhead)
- [ ] Documentation updated with new execution patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Central execution router vs. distributed execution points
- Context isolation mechanisms for app vs. module commands
- Command parsing strategy for [app]/[api]/[method] patterns
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Dependencies
- Current app execution points must be identified and cataloged
- Module system must support context-aware execution
- May depend on completion of app overlay pattern (issue #027)

### Performance Implications
- Additional parsing and routing overhead for each command
- Context switching costs between app and module execution
- Memory footprint for maintaining execution contexts

### Security Considerations
- Ensure spl-internal-only execution scope is enforced
- Prevent external access to execution context
- Validate command routing doesn't expose unintended functionality
- Context isolation between different app executions
