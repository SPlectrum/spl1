## Overview
Implement SE-1 prototype: Git Workflow Enforcement Engine to eliminate procedural errors in git branch management through rigid rule enforcement.

## Problem
Current git workflows require manual execution of complex sequences leading to:
- Forgotten post-PR main sync (branches diverge) 
- Skipped SESSION_START sync (working with stale code)
- Manual merge conflict resolution errors
- Inconsistent workflow execution

## Solution  
Replace manual procedures with automated rule enforcement that makes incorrect execution impossible.

## Implementation Scope

### Phase 1: Basic Enforcement
- Git hooks for state validation
- Wrapper scripts for atomic workflow execution
- Post-PR sync automation

### Phase 2: Command Interface
- `se1 session-start` → Complete SESSION_START workflow
- `se1 unplanned-work <description>` → Full unplanned cycle  
- `se1 issue-work <issue-number>` → Issue branch creation with sync

### Phase 3: Integration
- GitHub webhook integration
- Claude Code workflow integration
- Cross-session state persistence

## Success Criteria
- Zero procedural git workflow errors
- Reduced AI cognitive load for procedural tasks
- Consistent workflow execution across sessions
- Graceful handling of conflict scenarios

## Documentation
See [SE-1 Git Workflow Enforcement Engine Specification](./docs/se-1-git-workflow-enforcement-spec.md) for complete technical details.

## Epic
SE - SPlectrum Engines

## Priority
High - Addresses immediate operational pain point while establishing SE prototype foundation.
