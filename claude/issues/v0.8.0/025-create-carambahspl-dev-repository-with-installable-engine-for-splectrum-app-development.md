# Create carambah/spl-dev repository with installable engine for splectrum app development

## Problem Statement
Create the end-goal carambah/spl-dev repository that serves as an installable SPlectrum development engine for building splectrum applications. This repository will contain the extracted, composable components from spl1 that can be deployed and used by app implementation repositories.

## Required Work
Extract and restructure spl1 components into a deployable spl-dev engine that:
1. **Repository Creation**: Establish carambah/spl-dev with proper structure
2. **Engine Composition**: Define modules, apps, and dependencies architecture
3. **Installable Component**: Package as ready-to-deploy development engine
4. **Integration Layer**: Enable seamless use in splectrum app repos

## Work Plan

### 1. Repository Structure Creation
```
carambah/spl-dev/
├── modules/          # Core SPlectrum modules extracted from spl1
├── apps/            # Application templates and scaffolding
├── dependencies/    # Curated dependency management
├── install/         # Installation scripts and packaging
├── docs/           # Usage documentation for app developers
└── examples/       # Reference implementations
```

### 2. Module Definition & Extraction
- Extract core SPlectrum functionality from spl1
- Define clean module interfaces and dependencies
- Implement module composition system
- Create dependency resolution mechanism

### 3. Installable Engine Packaging
- Design installation workflow for app repositories
- Create deployment scripts and configuration
- Implement version management and updates
- Package as distributable component

### 4. App Repository Integration
- Define interface for splectrum app repositories to consume spl-dev
- Create development workflow integration
- Implement module loading and composition in target apps
- Provide CLI tools for app development

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Repository Created**: carambah/spl-dev repository established with proper structure
- [ ] **Modules Extracted**: Core SPlectrum modules extracted from spl1 with clean interfaces
- [ ] **Dependencies Defined**: Clear dependency management and module composition system
- [ ] **Installation Package**: Deployable component that can be installed in app repositories
- [ ] **Integration Working**: Splectrum app repos can successfully use spl-dev engine
- [ ] **Documentation Complete**: Usage docs for app developers consuming spl-dev
- [ ] **Examples Provided**: Reference implementations demonstrating spl-dev usage
- [ ] **Version Management**: Versioning and update mechanism for spl-dev releases

## Technical Considerations
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between engine and app-specific code
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies, self-contained where possible
- **Performance**: Efficient module loading and composition
- **Security**: Secure installation and dependency management
- **Compatibility**: Support for multiple splectrum app repository patterns
- **Extensibility**: Plugin system for custom modules and extensions
