## Objective
Extend spl/error API to support TDD workflow requirements including test failure packaging, notification systems, and comprehensive error reporting.

## Requirements
- Test failure error packaging and categorization
- Error notification and reporting systems
- Integration with TDD workflow architecture
- Enhanced error context and stack trace management
- Error aggregation and analysis capabilities

## Tasks
- [ ] Add test failure error packaging to spl/error/catch.js
- [ ] Implement error notification system
- [ ] Add error categorization and tagging
- [ ] Enhance error context capture for TDD workflows
- [ ] Design error aggregation and reporting patterns
- [ ] Add integration points for TDD framework

## Dependencies
- Supports issue #17 (TDD workflow architecture)
- Foundation for comprehensive TDD implementation
- Integrates with existing spl/error/catch.js patterns

## Strategic Value
Provides robust error handling foundation for TDD implementation and improved debugging workflows across the platform.
