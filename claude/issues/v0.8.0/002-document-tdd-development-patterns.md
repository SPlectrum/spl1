# Document TDD development patterns

Objective
## Objective
Document TDD development patterns and workflows using the core spl/test API.

## Documentation Scope

### **TDD Workflow Integration**
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle with spl/test API
- Test-first development patterns
- Requirement testing methodologies
- Git commit patterns for TDD workflow

### **Developer Guidelines**
- Using spl/test/run for command testing
- Assertion patterns with spl/test/assert
- Expected outcome setup with spl/test/expect  
- Debug workflow with spl/test/debug
- Integration with existing development processes

### **Test Development Patterns**
```bash
# Example TDD workflow
./spl_execute spl test spl/test/expect -workspace {} -stdout "success" -exitCode 0
./spl_execute spl test spl/test/run -command "spl/blob/get" -args ["-uri", "test://data"] -debug true
./spl_execute spl test spl/test/assert -type "equals" -target "exitCode" -expected 0
```

### **Integration Examples**
- Testing with existing test-suite app
- Dual output channel analysis examples
- Debug flag usage patterns
- Error collection integration

## Deliverables
- **TDD Methodology Documentation**: Complete developer guide
- **API Usage Examples**: Practical spl/test API examples
- **Workflow Integration**: Git and development process integration
- **Best Practices**: Testing patterns and recommendations

## Dependencies
- Core spl/test API implementation (issue #67)
- spl/error enhancement completion (issue #68)  
- TDD workflow architecture understanding

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete TDD methodology documentation
- [ ] spl/test API usage examples and patterns
- [ ] Developer workflow integration guide
- [ ] Git commit and branch pattern documentation
- [ ] Best practices and recommendations
- [ ] Integration with existing development processes

## Future Evolution
Foundation for sophisticated TDD tooling and automation in subsequent versions.
