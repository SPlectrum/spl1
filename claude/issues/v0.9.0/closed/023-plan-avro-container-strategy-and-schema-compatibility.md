# Plan AVRO container strategy and schema compatibility

Problem Statement
## Objective
Research and design AVRO container formats and schema compatibility strategy for spl1.

## Scope
Plan the container and compatibility approach for AVRO schema distribution and evolution.

## Planning Tasks
- [ ] Research AVRO container formats for schema distribution
- [ ] Design schema registry/catalog system for schema management
- [ ] Plan version compatibility and schema evolution approach
- [ ] Research schema fingerprinting and resolution strategies
- [ ] Document container and compatibility strategy

## Technical Considerations
- Schema versioning and backward compatibility
- Container format selection (single-object, file-based, etc.)
- Schema resolution and fingerprinting
- Distribution and packaging requirements
- Integration with spl1 data architecture

## Dependencies
- Requires AVRO schema architecture completion (issue #21)

## Deliverables
- AVRO container strategy document
- Schema compatibility framework design
- Version evolution plan
- Integration specifications
