# Design AVRO to JSON generation system for command-line compatibility

Problem Statement
## Objective
Architect the generation system that creates command-line argument JSON from AVRO schemas.

## Scope
Design the system that will generate the existing `*_arguments.json` format from AVRO schemas to maintain command-line parsing and help system compatibility.

## Planning Tasks
- [ ] Architect AVRO â†’ JSON generator system
- [ ] Plan integration with existing command-line parsing/help systems  
- [ ] Design template system for JSON generation from AVRO metadata
- [ ] Ensure generated JSON maintains current command-line compatibility
- [ ] Plan automated regeneration workflow

## Technical Considerations
- Current `headers`/`value` JSON structure must be preserved for command-line args
- Help system integration must remain functional
- Generation should be automated and reproducible
- Template flexibility for future command-line format changes

## Dependencies
- Requires AVRO schema architecture completion (issue #21)

## Deliverables
- Generator system architecture design
- JSON template specifications
- Integration plan with existing systems
- Implementation roadmap
