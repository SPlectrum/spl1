# Create AVRO architecture implementation plan

Problem Statement
## Objective
Synthesize AVRO research and design work into cohesive implementation roadmap.

## Scope
Create comprehensive implementation plan combining findings from AVRO architecture, generation system, and container strategy planning.

## Planning Tasks
- [ ] Synthesize findings from schema architecture design (issue #21)
- [ ] Integrate AVRO â†’ JSON generation system design (issue #55)
- [ ] Incorporate container strategy and compatibility plan (issue #56)
- [ ] Define integration points with existing spl1 systems
- [ ] Plan migration strategy from current JSON schemas
- [ ] Create detailed technical specifications for implementation
- [ ] Define implementation phases and dependencies

## Technical Considerations
- Coordination with CAE-1 unified data API work
- Integration with TDD-1 validation framework
- Migration timeline and compatibility requirements
- Implementation resource requirements

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of issues #21, #55, #56
- Coordinates with CAE-1 and TDD-1 epic work

## Deliverables
- Comprehensive AVRO implementation roadmap
- Technical implementation specifications
- Migration plan and timeline
- Integration strategy document
