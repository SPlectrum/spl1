# Implement container strategy for external tool dependencies

Problem Statement
## Objective
Implement containerized approach for external tool dependencies as part of BARE minimal dependency architecture.

## Scope
Containerize all external executable tools used by SPlectrum APIs with multi-arch builds and clean API wrapper integration.

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Containerize external tools: git, 7zip, gh, podman
- [ ] Create multi-architecture container builds (amd64, arm64, armv7)
- [ ] Implement container API wrappers in SPlectrum modules
- [ ] Create container runtime management system
- [ ] Establish container build automation pipeline
- [ ] Implement container image verification and signing

## Technical Requirements
- Multi-arch Dockerfile definitions for each tool
- Consistent API wrapper pattern across all containerized tools
- Container runtime abstraction layer
- Image verification for security
- Automated build pipeline for container updates

## Container Architecture
```
vendor/containers/
├── git/              # Git operations container
├── 7zip/             # Archive operations container  
├── gh/               # GitHub CLI container
└── podman/           # Container runtime container
```

## Pear Considerations
- Pre-built images for common architectures
- On-demand building for specific platforms
- Container image verification for peer-to-peer distribution
- Offline operation capability

## Dependencies
- Requires BARE minimal dependency architecture (issue #19) completion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All external tools successfully containerized
- [ ] Multi-arch builds working for common platforms
- [ ] API wrappers integrated and tested
- [ ] Container build automation functional
- [ ] Container verification pipeline established
