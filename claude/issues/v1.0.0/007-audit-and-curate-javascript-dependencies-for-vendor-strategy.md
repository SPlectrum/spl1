# Audit and curate JavaScript dependencies for vendor strategy

Problem Statement
## Objective
Audit current Node.js dependencies and create curated vendor forks for BARE minimal dependency architecture.

## Scope
Implement JavaScript module vendoring strategy - audit, fork, and curate all JavaScript dependencies required by SPlectrum.

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Audit all Node.js dependencies across SPlectrum modules
- [ ] Categorize dependencies: Core Runtime, Cryptographic, Development  
- [ ] Identify essential vs. removable functionality in each dependency
- [ ] Create vendor forks of essential dependencies in `vendor/deps/`
- [ ] Implement minimal versions removing unused functionality
- [ ] Document dependency usage patterns and requirements
- [ ] Establish vendor maintenance automation

## Technical Requirements
- Fork upstream repositories for all required JavaScript modules
- Create minimal versions with only SPlectrum-needed functionality
- Establish security-first curation process
- Version pinning for all vendored dependencies
- Automated upstream monitoring and security scanning

## Vendor Architecture
```
vendor/deps/
├── minimist/          # Command-line argument parsing
├── path-utils/        # File system path utilities  
├── crypto-utils/      # Cryptographic functions
├── stream-utils/      # Stream processing utilities
└── json-utils/        # JSON manipulation utilities
```

## Pear Considerations
- Dependencies must be self-contained for peer-to-peer distribution
- No external package manager access during runtime
- Deterministic builds for peer verification
- Complete offline operation capability

## Dependencies
- Requires BARE minimal dependency architecture (issue #19) completion
- May require Node.js dependency audit completion (issue #18)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete audit of current JavaScript dependencies
- [ ] Vendor forks created for all essential dependencies
- [ ] Minimal functionality versions implemented
- [ ] Security review completed for all vendored dependencies
- [ ] Vendor maintenance automation implemented
- [ ] Documentation for vendor maintenance process
