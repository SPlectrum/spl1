   - Log intervention for pattern analysis
```

**SE API Integration:**
```bash
# SE container calls for help
se request-intervention CONFLICT_RESOLUTION --workflow-id abc123 --context merge_conflict

# Claude resolves and signals continuation  
se continue-workflow abc123 --resolution-applied
```

## SE Container Communication Patterns

### Standard Intervention Request Pattern
```bash
# SE container requests help
se request-intervention <WORKFLOW_TYPE> --workflow-id <ID> --context <CONTEXT> [--priority urgent]

# Claude responds with intervention
claude: <analysis and resolution>

# Claude signals continuation
se continue-workflow <ID> --resolution-applied [--modified-files file1,file2]
```

### Status Monitoring Pattern
```bash
# Claude checks SE workflow status
se status --all
se status --workflow-id abc123 --detailed

# SE provides status updates
se notify --workflow-id abc123 --status intervention_needed --type conflict_resolution
```

### Orchestration Pattern
```bash
# Claude orchestrates complex workflows
se orchestrate --workflows "A,B,C" --dependencies "A->B,A->C" --parallel-limit 2
se monitor --orchestration-id xyz789 --intervention-callback claude
```
